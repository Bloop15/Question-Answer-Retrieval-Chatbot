DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF MACHINE LEARNING EXPERIMENTS

This topic focuses on designing fair and reliable machine learning experiments. It includes data splitting, performance evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, avoiding leakage, and testing statistical significance. The goal is to estimate true generalization performance and enable valid comparison between methods.

1. Importance of Experiment Design

Good design ensures:

Fair comparison of algorithms

Correct performance estimation

Avoiding data leakage and misleading results

Reproducible conclusions

Poor design leads to:

Overfitting and bias

Invalid claims

Non-reproducible outcomes

2. Training, Validation, Test Strategy

Training set:

Used to learn model parameters

Validation set:

Used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection

Test set:

Used only once at the end to estimate final generalization

Methods:

Holdout method: one-time split (e.g., 70/15/15)

K-fold cross-validation: train on K-1 folds, test on remaining fold, average results

Leave-One-Out CV: special case of K=N (high cost, high variance)

Cross-validation improves stability and reduces sensitivity to a specific data split.

3. Performance Metrics

Classification:

Accuracy

Error rate

Precision, Recall, F1

Confusion matrix

ROC-AUC

Regression:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R² score

Ranking:

Precision@k

Mean Average Precision

NDCG

Metric must match the problem and class distribution.

4. Statistical Significance Testing

Needed when comparing algorithms to ensure observed improvement is not due to chance.

Common tests:

Paired t-test (with CV results)

McNemar test (same test set predictions)

Wilcoxon signed-rank test (non-parametric alternative)

5. Overfitting, Underfitting, and Model Selection

Overfitting: low training error, high test error

Underfitting: high training and test error

Validation or CV is used to:

Choose model complexity

Select best hyperparameters

Determine early stopping for iterative models

6. Hyperparameter Search

Grid search: exhaustive but expensive

Random search: explores space efficiently

Bayesian optimization: models performance and selects promising configurations

Used to tune parameters like SVM regularization, neural network learning rate, etc.

7. Avoiding Data Leakage

Data leakage occurs when information from test data influences training.

Examples:

Scaling using whole dataset

Feature selection before CV

Cross-contamination between folds

Best practice:

All preprocessing must be performed inside each training fold independently

8. Baselines and Control Methods

Always compare against:

Simple baselines (majority class, random prediction)

Well-known standard methods

Baselines prevent overstating improvements.

9. Experimental Protocol

A complete experiment should include:

Problem statement and goals

Dataset description

Preprocessing procedure

Metrics

Hyperparameter search method

Train/validation/test strategy

Repeated trials and variance reporting

Statistical testing

Reproducible setup (random seeds, code)

10. Confidence Intervals and Variance

Report mean and variability of results:

Standard deviation or confidence intervals

Multiple runs with different random splits

This supports robust comparison.

11. Learning Curves

Plot performance vs. training data size.
Used to analyze:

Data sufficiency

Overfitting or underfitting behavior

Whether additional data would improve performance

12. Common Failures

Mistakes include:

Using test set for multiple tuning cycles

Ignoring class imbalance

Inconsistent data handling between models

Solutions:

Stratified sampling

Balanced metrics (e.g., F1, AUC)

Careful CV design

13. Reporting and Reproducibility

Reports must allow replication:

Clear procedure

Explicit hyperparameters

Complete dataset and code accessibility

Reproducibility is a core requirement for scientific validity.

Summary

Machine learning experiments must be designed to estimate true generalization performance and fairly compare models. Proper dataset splitting, unbiased evaluation metrics, hyperparameter tuning, and statistical testing are essential. Preventing leakage, reporting uncertainty, and using baselines support reliable and reproducible results.
