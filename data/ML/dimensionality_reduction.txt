DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION

Dimensionality reduction transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while preserving important structure. It helps reduce computation, improve visualization, remove noise, and avoid the curse of dimensionality.

Two approaches:

Feature selection: choose subset of original features

Feature extraction: create new transformed features
(this chapter focuses on extraction)

1. Curse of Dimensionality

High-dimensional spaces cause:

Data sparsity

Distance measures becoming less meaningful

Need for exponentially more samples

Unstable covariance estimation

Reducing dimensionality improves learning performance.

2. Feature Selection vs Feature Extraction

Feature selection:

Keeps subset of original variables

Feature extraction:

Transforms data into a new feature space

Examples: PCA, LDA

This topic focuses on feature extraction methods.

3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA finds new directions (principal components) that capture maximum variance. Data is projected into a lower-dimensional subspace while removing correlation.

Key ideas:

Eigenvectors define principal directions

Eigenvalues measure variance in each direction

Keep top components to retain most information

Advantages:

Reduces dimensionality efficiently

Decorrelates features

Widely used for compression and visualization

Limitations:

Linear only

Sensitive to scaling and outliers

Does not use class labels

4. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

LDA is supervised and maximizes class separability by:

Maximizing between-class scatter

Minimizing within-class scatter

Differences from PCA:

PCA focuses on variance

LDA uses class labels to improve discrimination

Properties:

Produces at most C−1 dimensions for C classes

Works well for classification tasks

Limitations:

Assumes Gaussian class distributions with equal covariance

Fails when feature dimension is much larger than sample size

5. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)

MDS embeds data into a low-dimensional space while preserving pairwise distances. Used for visualization when only distance information is available.

6. Isomap

Isomap preserves geodesic (manifold-based) distances.

Procedure:

Build nearest-neighbor graph

Compute shortest path distances

Apply classical MDS

Useful for nonlinear manifold structures.

7. Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)

LLE assumes each point can be reconstructed from its neighbors. It finds a low-dimensional embedding preserving local geometry.

Advantages:

Captures nonlinear manifold structure

8. Autoencoders

Autoencoders are neural networks that learn compressed representations.

Structure:

Encoder reduces dimension

Decoder reconstructs input

Properties:

Nonlinear

Scales to complex data (images, speech)

Supports deep architectures

Variants include denoising autoencoders and variational autoencoders.

9. When to Use Each Method

PCA:

Linear relationships

Fast compression

Unsupervised feature reduction

LDA:

Classification tasks with labels

Want maximum class separation

MDS, Isomap, LLE:

Nonlinear manifolds

Visualization and embedding

Autoencoders:

Large datasets

Highly nonlinear structure

Summary

Dimensionality reduction improves learning efficiency and performance. PCA captures maximum variance, whereas LDA uses label information to enhance class separation. Nonlinear methods like MDS, Isomap, LLE, and autoencoders better preserve manifold structure in complex data. These techniques help mitigate high-dimensional challenges such as overfitting and computational cost.
