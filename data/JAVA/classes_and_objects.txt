CLASSES AND OBJECTS IN JAVA

Java is an object-oriented language. Classes and objects are the core building blocks of Java programs.

WHAT IS A CLASS?

A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines fields (data) and methods (behavior).

Example:
class Student {
int roll;
String name;
void display() {
System.out.println(roll + " " + name);
}
}

A class does not occupy memory until an object is created.

WHAT IS AN OBJECT?

An object is an instance of a class. It has state (values in variables), behavior (methods), and identity (memory location).

Object creation:
Student s1 = new Student();

OBJECT CREATION PROCESS

Student s = new Student();

Student is the class name.
s is the reference variable.
new allocates memory.
Student() calls the constructor.

Memory is allocated in heap.

ACCESSING FIELDS AND METHODS

Using dot operator:

s.roll = 1;
s.name = "John";
s.display();

FIELDS OR INSTANCE VARIABLES

Declared inside a class but outside methods. Each object has its own copy.

Example:
class Car {
String color;
int speed;
}

METHODS

Define actions or behavior.

Example:
void run() {
System.out.println("Car is running");
}

THIS KEYWORD

Refers to the current object.
Used to access instance variables, call constructors, and pass the current object.

Example:
this.name = name;

STATIC MEMBERS

Belong to the class, not objects.

Example static variable:
static int count;

Static method:
static void show() {
System.out.println("Static method");
}

Access static members using the class name. Static methods cannot directly access instance variables.

MEMORY ALLOCATION IN JAVA

Heap: objects
Stack: local variables and method calls
Method Area: class information and static data

ANONYMOUS OBJECTS

Objects created without a reference.
Example:
new Student().display();

Used when object is needed only once.

OBJECT INITIALIZATION

Different ways to initialize objects:
Using reference variables:
s.roll = 1;
s.name = "John";

Using method:
void setData(int r, String n) {
roll = r;
name = n;
}

Using constructor:
Student(int r, String n) {
roll = r;
name = n;
}

ACCESS MODIFIERS FOR CLASS MEMBERS

public: accessible everywhere
private: accessible only in same class
protected: accessible in same package and subclasses
default: accessible only in same package

NESTED CLASSES

Class declared inside another class.

Types include: member inner class, static nested class, local inner class, anonymous inner class

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLASS AND OBJECT

A class is a blueprint and does not use memory. An object is an instance of a class and occupies memory. One class can create many independent objects.

BASIC EXAMPLE PROGRAM

class Student {
int roll;
String name;

void display() {
    System.out.println(roll + " " + name);
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Student s1 = new Student();
    s1.roll = 101;
    s1.name = "Alice";
    s1.display();
}


}

Output:
101 Alice

SUMMARY

A class defines structure and behavior. Objects are created using the new keyword. Important concepts include fields, methods, this keyword, static members, object creation, and memory management. These fundamentals are required before learning constructors, inheritance, and other OOP concepts.
