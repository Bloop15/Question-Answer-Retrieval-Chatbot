INHERITANCE IN JAVA

Inheritance is an important object oriented programming concept which allows a class to acquire the fields and methods of another class. It improves code reusability, maintainability, extensibility, and supports polymorphism.

WHAT IS INHERITANCE

Inheritance allows one class (subclass or child class) to inherit properties and behavior from another class (superclass or parent class).

Example:
class Animal {
void eat() { System.out.println("Eating"); }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
void bark() { System.out.println("Barking"); }
}

TYPES OF INHERITANCE IN JAVA

Java supports the following types of inheritance:
Single inheritance: one parent and one child.
class A { }
class B extends A { }

Multilevel inheritance: A becomes parent of B, and B becomes parent of C.
class A { }
class B extends A { }
class C extends B { }

Hierarchical inheritance: multiple classes inherit from a single parent.

Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity (diamond problem). However, it supports multiple inheritance using interfaces.

WHY MULTIPLE INHERITANCE IS NOT SUPPORTED

Java prevents the diamond problem. If a class inherits from two classes that have the same method, ambiguity occurs. To avoid this, multiple inheritance using classes is not allowed.

SUPERCLASS AND SUBCLASS

A subclass inherits:
Non private fields
Non private methods

A subclass does not inherit:
Constructors
Private members
Final methods

SUPER KEYWORD

super refers to parent class. It is used to call parent class constructor, access parent fields, and call parent methods.
super.display();
super(10);

METHOD OVERRIDING

A subclass can redefine a method from the parent class with the same name, parameters, and return type.
The parent method must not be final or private.

Example:
class Animal {
void sound() { System.out.println("Some sound"); }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
@Override
void sound() { System.out.println("Bark"); }
}

@Override ANNOTATION

Used to ensure proper method overriding. The compiler shows an error if the method signature is incorrect.

CONSTRUCTOR CALLING ORDER

When creating a child class object:
Parent class constructor executes first, then child class constructor.

Example:
class A { A() { System.out.println("A"); } }
class B extends A { B() { System.out.println("B"); } }
new B();

Output:
A
B

IS-A RELATIONSHIP

Inheritance represents an IS-A relationship.
Dog is-a Animal
Car is-a Vehicle

This is important for runtime polymorphism.

COMPOSITION VS INHERITANCE

Inheritance represents an IS-A relationship.
Composition represents a HAS-A relationship.
class Car {
Engine e = new Engine();
}
Composition is preferred when the relationship is not strictly IS-A.

FINAL METHODS AND FINAL CLASSES

A final method cannot be overridden.
A final class cannot be inherited.

ABSTRACT CLASSES

Abstract classes provide partial implementation and enforce subclass-specific behavior.
abstract class Animal {
abstract void sound();
}
Used as parent classes in hierarchies.

ACCESS MODIFIERS AND INHERITANCE

public: inherited and accessible in child class
protected: inherited and accessible even in different package subclasses
default: inherited within same package only
private: not inherited

EXAMPLE PROGRAM

class Animal {
void eat() {
System.out.println("Eating...");
}
}
class Dog extends Animal {
void bark() {
System.out.println("Barking...");
}
}
class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Dog d = new Dog();
d.eat();
d.bark();
}
}

Output:
Eating...
Barking...

ADVANTAGES OF INHERITANCE

Code reusability
Avoids duplication
Supports polymorphism
Better structure and maintenance
Easy extension of existing systems

DISADVANTAGES OF INHERITANCE

Increases coupling between classes
Deep inheritance hierarchies complicate code
Misuse can lead to fragile design

SUMMARY

Inheritance allows classes to reuse and extend existing code. It supports IS-A relationships, method overriding, and polymorphism. Java restricts multiple inheritance using classes to avoid ambiguity. Key concepts include extends, super, abstract classes, access modifiers, and constructor order.
