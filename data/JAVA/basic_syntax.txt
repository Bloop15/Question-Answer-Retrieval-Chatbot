BASIC SYNTAX IN JAVA

Java syntax is simple and similar to C/C++. A Java program consists of classes, methods, variables, statements, and expressions.

STRUCTURE OF A JAVA PROGRAM

Example:
class Hello {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Hello, Java");
}
}

Key points:

class defines a class

main() is the entry point

System.out.println() prints output to the console

COMMENTS IN JAVA

Used to explain or document code.

Types of comments:

Single-line: // comment

Multi-line: /* comment */

Documentation: /** comment */

IDENTIFIERS

Identifiers are names given to variables, methods, classes, and packages.

Rules:

Cannot begin with a number

Cannot use reserved keywords

Case-sensitive

Can include letters, digits, $ and _

Valid examples: age, count1, _name, $value
Invalid examples: 2age, class, name@

KEYWORDS (RESERVED WORDS)

Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
Examples: class, public, static, void, int, new, return, if, else, break, try, catch
Java has 53 keywords in Java 17 and above.

DATA TYPES

Java is statically typed. Every variable must have a data type.

Primitive data types:
byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean

Non-primitive data types:
Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interfaces, Objects

VARIABLES IN JAVA

Declaration:
int age;

Initialization:
age = 20;

Declaration + initialization:
int age = 20;

Types of variables:

Local: inside methods

Instance: declared inside class but outside methods

Static: shared across all objects of the class

LITERALS IN JAVA

Fixed constant values assigned to variables.

Examples:
int x = 10;
double y = 3.14;
char ch = 'A';
String s = "Java";
boolean flag = true;

OPERATORS

Arithmetic operators: + - * / %
Relational operators: == != > < >= <=
Logical operators: && || !
Assignment operators: = += -= *= /= %=
Increment and decrement: ++ --
Ternary operator: condition ? value1 : value2

INPUT AND OUTPUT IN JAVA

Console Output:
System.out.println("Hello");
System.out.print("Hi");

Console Input using Scanner:
import java.util.Scanner;
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int x = sc.nextInt();
String s = sc.nextLine();

TYPE CASTING

Implicit or widening conversion (automatic):
int x = 10;
double y = x;

Explicit or narrowing conversion (manual):
double a = 9.99;
int b = (int) a;

ESCAPE SEQUENCES

\n new line
\t tab
" double quote
