INTERFACES AND PACKAGES IN JAVA

Interfaces and packages are important in Java for abstraction, modular development, code organization, and avoiding naming conflicts.

INTERFACES IN JAVA

An interface is a blueprint of a class. It contains abstract methods and may include default methods, static methods, and private methods (Java 9 and above). Interfaces help achieve full abstraction and support multiple inheritance.

Example:
interface Animal {
void sound();
}
class Dog implements Animal {
public void sound() {
System.out.println("Bark");
}
}

Features of interfaces:
Cannot be instantiated.
Implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces.
Variables are public static final by default.
Methods are public and abstract by default.
Supports multiple inheritance.

1.1 Default methods (Java 8 and above)
interface Animal {
default void eat() {
System.out.println("Eating");
}
}

1.2 Static methods in interfaces
interface MathUtil {
static int square(int x) {
return x * x;
}
}
Usage:
MathUtil.square(5);

1.3 Private methods (Java 9 and above)
Used for code reusability inside interfaces.

1.4 Multiple inheritance using interfaces
interface A { void show(); }
interface B { void display(); }
class C implements A, B {
public void show() { }
public void display() { }
}

1.5 Interface vs Abstract Class

Interface:
Supports full abstraction.
Only constants allowed as variables.
No constructors.
Supports multiple inheritance.

Abstract class:
Supports partial abstraction.
Allows normal variables.
Constructors allowed.
Does not support multiple inheritance using classes.

PACKAGES IN JAVA

A package is a group of related classes and interfaces. It helps in organization, reuse, avoiding naming conflicts, and controlling access.

Two types:
Built in packages (Java API)
User defined packages

2.1 Examples of built in packages
java.lang: basic classes such as String, Math
java.util: data structures, utility classes like ArrayList and Scanner
java.io: input and output
java.net: networking
java.awt and javax.swing: GUI components

2.2 Creating a package
Use the package keyword.
package mypack;
public class A {
public void show() {
System.out.println("Hello");
}
}

File must be saved in folder structure:
mypack/A.java

2.3 Using a package
import mypack.A;
class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
A obj = new A();
obj.show();
}
}

2.4 Accessing without import
mypack.A obj = new mypack.A();

2.5 Subpackages
Packages inside packages form hierarchical organization.
Example:
com.company.project.module

2.6 Classpath
Java uses classpath to locate packages.
Set classpath and execute programs referencing packages when needed.

2.7 Access modifiers and packages

public: accessible everywhere
protected: accessible in same package and subclasses
default: accessible only in same package
private: accessible only inside the same class

INTERFACES INSIDE PACKAGES

Both concepts can be combined.

Example:
package shapes;
public interface Shape {
void draw();
}

package shapes;
public class Circle implements Shape {
public void draw() {
System.out.println("Circle");
}
}

import shapes.*;
class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Shape s = new Circle();
s.draw();
}
}

REAL WORLD USE CASES

Interfaces:
Payment processing systems
Logging systems
API definitions
Event listeners

Packages:
Organizing enterprise projects
Creating reusable modules
Framework and library development
Modular backend services

SUMMARY

Interfaces help achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance while packages organize related classes into structured modules. Both concepts are necessary for scalable and maintainable Java applications.
