METHODS AND PARAMETER PASSING IN JAVA

Methods in Java are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. They support modularity, readability, and code reuse. Java allows method definition, method calling, method overloading, and pass-by-value parameter passing.

WHAT IS A METHOD

A method is a group of statements that performs an operation.

Syntax:
returnType methodName(parameters) {
// body
}

Example:
int add(int a, int b) {
return a + b;
}

TYPES OF METHODS

User defined methods: created by the programmer.
Predefined methods: provided by Java API, such as Math.sqrt() and System.out.println().

Static methods:
Belong to the class and called using ClassName.method().

Instance methods:
Belong to a specific object and called using obj.method().

METHOD SIGNATURE

A method's signature includes:
Method name
Parameter types and order

Return type is not part of the signature.

Example: add(int, int)

RETURN TYPE

The return statement sends a value back.
If no value is returned, the method uses void.

Example:
void print() {
System.out.println("Hello");
}

PARAMETERS AND ARGUMENTS

Parameters are variables in method definition.
Arguments are values passed during method call.

Example:
void greet(String name) // name is parameter
greet("Alice") // "Alice" is argument

PARAMETER PASSING IN JAVA

Java uses pass-by-value only.

Meaning:
A copy of the value is passed. The original is never directly modified by the function call.

6.1 Primitive types

Values are copied. Changing the parameter does not affect the original variable.

Example:
void change(int x) { x = 10; }
int a = 5;
change(a);
a remains 5

6.2 Objects

Objects are also passed by value, but the value is a reference.
So the method can modify object contents, but cannot make the caller reference a new object.

Modifying fields affects original object.
Reassigning the reference does not affect caller.

METHOD OVERLOADING

Same method name, but different parameter types or number or order of parameters.

Example:
int sum(int a, int b)
double sum(double a, double b)
int sum(int a, int b, int c)

Return type alone cannot differentiate overloaded methods.

VARARGS (VARIABLE ARGUMENTS)

Allows passing an unknown number of arguments.

Syntax:
void fun(int... a)

Rules:
Only one varargs parameter
Must be the last parameter

RECURSION

A method calling itself.
Requires:
Base case
Recursive step

Example:
int factorial(int n) {
if(n == 0) return 1;
return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

SCOPE OF VARIABLES

Local scope: inside method or block
Instance scope: instance variables accessible through object
Static scope: shared among all objects of a class

ACCESS MODIFIERS AND METHODS

public: accessible everywhere
private: within same class
protected: same package and subclasses
default: same package only

EXAMPLES

void greet() {
System.out.println("Hello");
}
int add(int a, int b) {
return a + b;
}
static int square(int x) {
return x * x;
}

SUMMARY

Methods enable modular and reusable code. Java always uses pass-by-value, including for objects where the reference value is copied. Key concepts include method overloading, static and instance methods, varargs, recursion, and access control.
