EXCEPTION HANDLING IN JAVA

Exception handling in Java is used to handle runtime errors gracefully. It prevents program crashes and ensures smooth execution by providing alternate flows using try, catch, finally, throw, throws, and custom exceptions.

WHAT IS AN EXCEPTION

An exception is an event that disrupts normal program flow during runtime. Common causes include:
Division by zero
Invalid array index
Null pointer access
File not found

If not handled, the program terminates abnormally.

EXCEPTION HIERARCHY

java.lang.Object
└── Throwable
├── Exception
│ ├── RuntimeException
│ └── Checked exceptions
└── Error

2.1 Throwable
Base class for all exceptions and errors.
Useful methods: getMessage(), printStackTrace()

2.2 Exception
Represents recoverable problems.
Two types:
Checked exceptions (checked at compile time)
Examples: IOException, SQLException, FileNotFoundException
Unchecked exceptions (runtime errors)
Examples: NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

2.3 Error
Serious issues not intended for handling by the application.
Examples: StackOverflowError, OutOfMemoryError

EXCEPTION HANDLING KEYWORDS

Java provides five keywords:
try
catch
finally
throw
throws

3.1 try block
Contains code that may throw an exception.
Example:
try {
int x = 10 / 0;
}

3.2 catch block
Handles exceptions thrown by try block.
catch(ArithmeticException e) {
System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero");
}
Multiple catch blocks allowed.

3.3 finally block
Executes always, even if exception occurs. Used for cleanup.
finally {
System.out.println("Finally block runs");
}

3.4 throw keyword
Used to explicitly throw an exception.
throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input");

3.5 throws keyword
Used in method declaration to signal that the method may throw exceptions.
void read() throws IOException { }

MULTIPLE CATCH BLOCKS

More specific exceptions must be caught before general ones.
try {
int a = arr[10];
}
catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
System.out.println("Invalid index");
}
catch(Exception e) {
System.out.println("General exception");
}

NESTED TRY CATCH

try {
try {
int x = 10 / 0;
}
catch(ArithmeticException e) {
System.out.println("Inner catch");
}
}
catch(Exception e) {
System.out.println("Outer catch");
}

TRY WITH RESOURCES (Java 7 and later)

Automatically closes resources such as file streams and database connections.
try(FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("a.txt")) {
}
catch(IOException e) {
}

CUSTOM EXCEPTIONS

User defined exceptions created by extending Exception or RuntimeException.
class AgeException extends Exception {
public AgeException(String msg) {
super(msg);
}
}

Usage:
if(age < 18)
throw new AgeException("Not eligible");

COMMON BUILT IN EXCEPTIONS

ArithmeticException: division by zero
NullPointerException: null object access
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: invalid array index
NumberFormatException: invalid conversion to number
ClassCastException: invalid type casting
IOException: input output error
FileNotFoundException: file not found
SQLException: database error

EXCEPTION PROPAGATION

If a method does not handle an exception, it is passed to the calling method and continues up the call stack until handled. Propagation stops once a catch block handles it.

EXAMPLE PROGRAM

class Demo {
public static void main(String[] args) {
try {
int a = 5 / 0;
}
catch(ArithmeticException e) {
System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero");
}
finally {
System.out.println("Always executed");
}
}
}

Output:
Cannot divide by zero
Always executed

BEST PRACTICES

Catch specific exceptions first.
Use finally for cleanup.
Do not ignore exceptions silently.
Use meaningful error messages.
Use custom exceptions where necessary.
Prefer try with resources for I/O code.
Avoid overusing exceptions in performance critical areas.

SUMMARY

Java exception handling prevents abnormal termination of programs by handling runtime errors using try, catch, finally, throw, throws, and custom exceptions. It improves software reliability and robustness by providing controlled error handling and recovery mechanisms.
