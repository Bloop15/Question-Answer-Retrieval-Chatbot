This topic covers C data types, constants, variables, operators, expressions, and type conversions. These form the core building blocks of C programs.

Data Types in C:
C provides several built-in types that define size, range, and interpretation of values.

Basic Types:
Integer types: char, short, int, long, long long and their unsigned forms
Floating types: float, double, long double
char stores single characters (typically 1 byte)

Derived Types:
Pointers, arrays, structures, unions, functions, and enumerations

Constants (Literals):
Integer constants:
10, 255, 0xFF (hex), 037 (octal)
Floating constants:
3.14, 2.5e6
Character constants:
'A', '\n', '\t'
String literals:
"Hello", "ABC\n"
Stored as arrays of characters terminated by '\0'.

Variable Declaration:
Variables must be declared before use.
int count;
float avg;
char grade;
May be initialized:
int x = 10;
double pi = 3.14;
Multiple declarations allowed:
int a, b = 5, c;

Type Conversions:
Arithmetic conversions occur in mixed-type expressions using promotion rules.
Example:
int i = 5;
double d = i;
Explicit conversion (cast):
double d = 5.6;
int x = (int)d;

Operators in C:

Arithmetic operators:

/ %
% works only with integers.

Relational operators:
< <= > >= == !=
Result is 1 (true) or 0 (false).

Logical operators:
&& || !
Use short-circuit evaluation.

Assignment operators:
= += -= *= /= %=

Increment and decrement:
++i, i++, --i, i--

Bitwise operators:
& | ^ ~ << >>
Used in hardware control, flags, and compression.

Conditional (ternary) operator:
condition ? expr1 : expr2

Comma operator:
Evaluates left to right and returns last value.
x = (i = 5, i + 2);

sizeof operator:
Returns number of bytes of a type or variable.
sizeof(int)
sizeof x

Expressions:
Expressions combine operators and operands to compute values.
Examples:
a + b * c
flag = (count > 0)

Precedence and Associativity:
Determine evaluation order. Higher precedence operators execute first.
Selected order from highest to lowest:
() [] -> .
! ~ ++ --

/ %

<< >>
< <= > >=
== !=
&
^
|
&&
||
?:
= += -=
,

Associativity:
Most operators are left-to-right.
Assignment and ?: are right-to-left.

Type Sizes and Machine Dependence:
Sizes vary by architecture. Typical 32-bit values:
char 1 byte
short 2 bytes
int 4 bytes
long 4 bytes
float 4 bytes
double 8 bytes
C remains portable because exact sizes depend on system but standard rules apply.

Summary:
C provides rich typing, constants, and operators to build efficient expressions. Understanding conversions, precedence, and evaluation rules is critical for correct and optimized programming.
