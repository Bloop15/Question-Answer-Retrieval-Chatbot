C is a general-purpose procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. It is widely used for operating systems, embedded systems, compilers, device drivers, and high-performance applications. C is the foundation for many modern languages including C++, Java, C#, Go, and Rust.

History and Features:
C was created for UNIX development. It was standardized as ANSI C (C89/C90), later updated to C99, C11, and C18.
Key features:
Low-level memory access
Fast execution
Portable across platforms
Procedural programming model
Rich operators and minimal standard library

Structure of a C Program:
A program consists of preprocessor directives, function definitions, variable declarations, and statements.
Example:
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
return 0;
}

First Program Example:
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
printf("Hello, World!\n");
return 0;
}
#include <stdio.h> includes standard I/O functions. main is the entry point. return 0 indicates successful execution.

Compilation and Execution:
C programs must be compiled.
Steps:
Preprocessing → Compilation → Assembly → Linking
Linux/macOS:
gcc program.c -o program
./program
Windows (MinGW):
gcc program.c -o program.exe
program.exe

Tokens in C:
Smallest elements of a program:
Keywords
Identifiers
Constants
String literals
Operators
Punctuation characters such as ; {} ()

Variables and Data Types:
Basic types: int, float, double, char
Derived types: arrays, pointers, structures, functions
Examples:
int a;
float b;
char c = 'A';

Constants and Literals:
Integer, floating, character, string, and enumeration constants.
Examples:
10
3.14
'A'
"Hello"

Basic Input and Output:
Uses stdio.h.
printf for output, scanf for input.
Example:
scanf("%d", &x);

Operators (Brief Overview):
Arithmetic: + - * / %
Relational: < <= > >= == !=
Logical: && || !
Bitwise: & | ^ ~ << >>
Assignment: = += -= *=
Conditional: ?:
Increment and decrement: ++ --

Example Program:
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
int a, b, sum;
printf("Enter two numbers: ");
scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
sum = a + b;
printf("Sum = %d\n", sum);
return 0;
}
Demonstrates input, output, variables, arithmetic, and control flow.

Summary:
C is efficient, portable, and close to hardware. It supports a structured approach to programming and remains widely used in system-level and performance-critical applications. Understanding C fundamentals is essential for deeper computer science and software development concepts.
