C uses the standard I/O library (stdio.h) to perform input and output with streams such as stdin, stdout, and stderr. These streams connect to keyboards, screens, and files.

Character Input and Output:
getchar():
Reads a single character and returns its ASCII value or EOF.
int c = getchar();

putchar():
Outputs a single character.
putchar('A');

Formatted Output:
printf():
printf("format string", values);
Format specifiers include:
%d %i %u %ld %lld for integers
%f %lf %e %g for floating point
%c for character
%s for string
%x %X for hexadecimal
%p for pointer
Example:
printf("Result: %d\n", x);

Formatted Input:
scanf():
Reads formatted input from standard input.
scanf("%d %f", &x, &y);
Requires variable addresses. Matching format specifiers is essential.

String Input and Output:
fgets() reads a line safely:
fgets(str, sizeof(str), stdin);
puts() prints a string with a newline:
puts("Hello");
gets() is unsafe and deprecated.

File Input and Output:
FILE pointer required for file operations.
Opening:
FILE *fp = fopen("data.txt", "r");
Modes: r (read), w (write), a (append), r+ (read/write), binary versions rb, wb.
Check for errors:
if (fp == NULL) { printf("Cannot open file"); }

Closing:
fclose(fp);

Reading:
getc(fp) reads a character
fgets(buffer, size, fp) reads a line
fscanf(fp, ...) reads formatted data

Writing:
putc('A', fp) writes a character
fputs("Hello", fp) writes a string
fprintf(fp, "Value: %d", x) formatted file output

Binary File I/O:
Used for structs and efficient storage.
Reading:
fread(&var, sizeof(var), 1, fp);
Writing:
fwrite(&var, sizeof(var), 1, fp);

Error Handling:
feof(fp) detects end-of-file
ferror(fp) detects I/O error
perror("Message") prints error based on errno

Command-Line Arguments:
main can receive input arguments:
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
argc is number of arguments
argv is an array of strings
Example:
./prog input.txt output.txt
argv[1] = "input.txt"

Example: Copy one file to another:
int c;
FILE *in = fopen("input.txt", "r");
FILE *out = fopen("output.txt", "w");
while ((c = getc(in)) != EOF)
putc(c, out);
fclose(in);
fclose(out);

Summary:
Standard I/O in C includes character I/O (getchar, putchar), formatted I/O (printf, scanf), string I/O (fgets, puts), file handling (fopen, fclose, fscanf, fprintf), binary I/O (fread, fwrite), and command-line argument processing.
