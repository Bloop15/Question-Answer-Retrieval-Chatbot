UNIX system calls provide low-level control for files, processes, and devices. They operate directly with the operating system and are essential for system programming and OS-level tools.

File Descriptors:
UNIX treats all files, terminals, and devices as byte streams identified by integer descriptors.
Standard descriptors:
0 stdin
1 stdout
2 stderr
open() returns the next available descriptor.

open():
Opens a file and returns a descriptor.
int open(const char *path, int flags, mode_t mode);
Common flags: O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR, O_CREAT, O_TRUNC, O_APPEND
Example:
int fd = open("log.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, 0644);

read():
Reads bytes from a descriptor.
ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
Returns: number of bytes read, 0 on EOF, −1 on error.

write():
Writes bytes to a descriptor.
ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
Used for logging, binary output, and low-level writes.

close():
Releases a descriptor.
close(fd);

lseek():
Repositions file offset.
off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);
whence: SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, SEEK_END

File Status:
stat() retrieves metadata:
file size, permissions, ownership, timestamps

unlink():
Deletes a directory entry for a file.
unlink("file.txt");

dup() and dup2():
Duplicate descriptors for redirection.
Example:
int fd = open("output.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, 0644);
dup2(fd, 1); // redirect stdout to file

Example Programs:
Copy file (cp style):
while ((n = read(fd1, buf, sizeof(buf))) > 0)
write(fd2, buf, n);

Word/line count (wc style):
Tracks newlines and transitions into/out of words.

Error Handling:
System calls set errno on failure.
perror("open failed");

Standard I/O vs System Calls:
Standard I/O (stdio): buffered, easier, portable
UNIX system calls: unbuffered, precise control

Summary:
UNIX system calls provide direct OS interaction with:
open, read, write, close for data
lseek for offset movement
stat for metadata
unlink for deletion
dup and dup2 for I/O redirection
They form the foundation for shells, system utilities, embedded software, and OS development.
