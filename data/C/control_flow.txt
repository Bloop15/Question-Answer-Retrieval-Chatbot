Control flow determines the order in which statements execute in a C program. C includes constructs for decision making, loops, branching, and scoping.

Conditional Statements:
Used to select actions based on conditions.

if statement:
if (condition) {
statements;
}
Executes block if condition is non-zero.

if–else:
if (condition) {
statements;
} else {
alternate statements;
}

Nested if–else: multiple levels of decision making.

else-if ladder: multiple mutually exclusive conditions.
if (x == 1) { ... }
else if (x == 2) { ... }
else { ... }

switch Statement:
Used for multi-way branching on int, char, or enum values.
switch (expression) {
case 1: statements; break;
case 2: statements; break;
default: statements;
}
break prevents fall-through. Expressions cannot be float or string.

Loops in C:
Used to repeat execution while condition is true.

while loop:
Entry-controlled; may execute zero times.
while (condition) { body; }

for loop:
General looping with initialization, condition, update.
for (init; condition; update) { body; }

do–while loop:
Exit-controlled; executes at least once.
do { body; } while (condition);

Loop Control Statements:
break: exits loop or switch immediately.
continue: skips remaining body and moves to next iteration.
goto: jumps to labeled statement; should be used sparingly.

Nested Loops:
Loops inside loops. Total iterations = product of loop counts.

Blocks and Scope:
A block is enclosed in braces {}.
Variables declared inside a block are local to that block.
Inner blocks can use outer variables; outer cannot use inner.
Variable shadowing is allowed (inner redeclares same name).

Common Pitfalls and Best Practices:
Use braces for clarity to avoid confusing indentation errors.
Avoid infinite loops unless intentional.
Use for loop when iteration count is known.
Avoid excessive use of goto; prefer structured control flow.

Examples:

Prime check using for and break:
int isPrime = 1;
for (int i = 2; i <= n/2; i++) {
if (n % i == 0) {
isPrime = 0;
break;
}
}

Menu using switch:
switch (choice) {
case 1: printf("Add"); break;
case 2: printf("Subtract"); break;
default: printf("Invalid");
}

Summation using while:
int sum = 0, i = 1;
while (i <= n) {
sum += i;
i++;
}

Summary:
Control flow constructs include conditional statements (if-else, switch), loops (while, for, do-while), and jump statements (break, continue, goto). Block structure defines scope and variable lifetime. These constructs determine program behavior and structure in C.
