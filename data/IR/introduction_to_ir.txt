INTRODUCTION TO INFORMATION RETRIEVAL (IR)

Information Retrieval (IR) is the process of searching and retrieving relevant information from large collections of unstructured or semi-structured data.
Search engines (Google, Bing, etc.) are practical examples of IR systems.

IR focuses on relevance-based retrieval rather than exact matching.

What is Information Retrieval?

IR involves:
• Representing and indexing text documents
• Searching collections efficiently
• Ranking documents based on similarity
• Retrieving the most relevant results to the query

Works with unstructured text such as:
• Web pages
• Articles
• Books
• Emails
• Reports

IR output is a ranked list of documents.

IR vs DBMS

Feature	IR	DBMS
Data type	Unstructured/semi-structured text	Structured tables
Query type	Keywords, natural language	SQL (exact match)
Results	Ranked by relevance	Exact matching results
Matching	Approximate	Precise
Evaluation	Relevance scoring	Correctness-based
Index structure	Inverted index	B-tree, Hash index

Basic IR System Architecture

Components:
3.1 Document Collection
Documents to be searched (web pages, PDFs, articles, e-books)

3.2 Text Processing
Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, normalization

3.3 Indexing
Builds inverted index: term → document postings

3.4 Query Processing
Transforms user input into searchable form

3.5 Ranking and Retrieval
Scores documents using similarity (TF-IDF, cosine similarity, BM25)

3.6 Evaluation
Measures retrieval performance using precision, recall, MAP, NDCG

Information Retrieval Models

4.1 Boolean Model
Uses logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
Exact matching only
No ranking

4.2 Vector Space Model (VSM)
Documents represented as numeric vectors
Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity
Supports ranked retrieval
Widely used in IR

4.3 Probabilistic Models
Estimates probability of document relevance
Examples: BM25, Binary Independence Model
High performance in many applications

Text Processing Pipeline

IR systems preprocess text for indexing:

• Tokenization: splitting into terms
• Stopword removal: remove frequent meaningless words
• Stemming: reduce to root form (running → run)
• Lemmatization: dictionary form reduction (studies → study)
• Normalization: lowercasing, punctuation removal, number handling

Inverted Index

Key structure for efficient search.

term → posting list of (document ID, frequency, positions)

Example:
data → (doc1:3), (doc5:1), (doc9:2)

Supports fast query evaluation.

Evaluating IR Systems

Common metrics:
• Precision: relevant retrieved / retrieved
• Recall: relevant retrieved / relevant total
• F1 Score: harmonic mean of precision and recall
• MAP: mean average precision across queries
• NDCG: measures ranking quality with graded relevance

Challenges in IR

• Polysemy (one word, many meanings: bank)
• Synonymy (different words, same meaning: car, automobile)
• Short queries (ambiguous), long queries (noisy)
• Scale: billions of documents require distributed indexing

Applications of IR

• Search engines
• Digital libraries
• E-commerce product search
• QA systems and chatbots
• Recommendation systems
• Legal and medical search
• Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Summary

Information Retrieval aims to retrieve the most relevant information from large unstructured data collections.
It uses preprocessing, inverted indexes, retrieval models (Boolean, VSM, probabilistic), ranking, and evaluation metrics.
IR technologies power today’s web-scale search engines and intelligent systems.
