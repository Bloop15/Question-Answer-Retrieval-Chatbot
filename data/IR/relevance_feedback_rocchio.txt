RELEVANCE FEEDBACK (ROCCHIO ALGORITHM)

Relevance feedback improves search results by adjusting the query based on which retrieved documents are relevant or irrelevant. It is commonly used in the Vector Space Model, learning user intent during retrieval.

WHAT IS RELEVANCE FEEDBACK?

Relevance feedback is an iterative loop:

User submits an initial query

System retrieves documents

User marks results as relevant or not relevant

System updates the query

More accurate results are retrieved

The updated query is moved closer to relevant documents and farther from non-relevant ones.

TYPES OF RELEVANCE FEEDBACK

2.1 Explicit Relevance Feedback
User directly marks documents as relevant or irrelevant.
Used in legal search, academic search, and patent retrieval.

2.2 Implicit Relevance Feedback
System infers relevance from:
Click behavior
Time spent on page
Scrolling
Used in web search engines and recommendation systems.

2.3 Pseudo Relevance Feedback (PRF)
Top retrieved documents are assumed relevant.
Used for improving search without user involvement.

ROCCHIO ALGORITHM

Rocchio is based on vector space representation and TF-IDF weighting. It modifies the query vector using centroids of relevant and non-relevant document vectors.

3.1 Rocchio Update Formula

Q_new = α Q_orig + (β / |D_r|) Σ d∈D_r d − (γ / |D_nr|) Σ d∈D_nr d

Where:
Q_orig = original query vector
D_r = set of relevant documents
D_nr = set of non-relevant documents
α, β, γ = control parameters

Typical values:
α = 1
β = 0.75
γ = 0.15

INTUITION BEHIND ROCCHIO

Increases weights of terms appearing in relevant documents
Decreases weights of terms from non-relevant documents
Retains influence of original query terms

This results in more accurate retrieval in the next iteration.

EXAMPLE (Illustrative)

Q_orig = [1, 0, 1]
Relevant docs = [1,1,1] and [1,2,1]
Non-relevant doc = [0,1,0]

Compute centroids and apply Rocchio formula to obtain an improved query vector.

QUERY EXPANSION USING ROCCHIO

Terms from relevant documents are added to the query with increased weight. This addresses synonymy and vocabulary mismatch.

PSEUDO RELEVANCE FEEDBACK

Steps:
Retrieve top k documents
Assume they are relevant
Apply Rocchio to update query
Retrieve again using updated query

Advantages:
No user interaction
Improves recall

Disadvantage:
Assumption may introduce noise

ADVANTAGES

Improves recall
Learns true user intent
Handles vocabulary mismatch
Boosts performance in domain-specific search

LIMITATIONS

Requires user involvement for explicit feedback
May incorporate irrelevant results in PRF
More computation required
May not be suitable for large real-time web search

APPLICATIONS

Academic and legal search engines
Enterprise search
Digital libraries
Recommendation systems
RAG-based retrieval systems

Summary

Relevance feedback refines a query using relevance judgments. The Rocchio Algorithm updates the query vector by moving it toward relevant document vectors and away from non-relevant ones. It improves retrieval effectiveness, especially in cases where vocabulary mismatch exists.
