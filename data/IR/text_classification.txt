TEXT CLASSIFICATION

Text classification assigns predefined labels to text documents. It is widely used in Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning.

Examples:
Spam vs Not Spam
Sentiment polarity
News topic categorization
Document routing
Intent detection

WHAT IS TEXT CLASSIFICATION?

Given a document d and a set of categories C = {c1, c2, …, cn},
the task is to determine class(d) ∈ C.

It is typically supervised learning when trained with labeled data.

TYPES OF TEXT CLASSIFICATION

2.1 Binary Classification
Two possible labels, e.g., Spam / Not Spam.

2.2 Multi-class Classification
Document assigned exactly one label from multiple classes.

2.3 Multi-label Classification
Document may belong to multiple categories.

2.4 Hierarchical Classification
Labels are structured in a taxonomy, e.g.,
Sports → Cricket → ODI.

TEXT REPRESENTATION METHODS

Documents must be converted into numeric vectors before classification.

3.1 Bag of Words (BoW)
Term frequency counts; ignores word order.

3.2 TF-IDF
Weighted vectors that reduce the influence of common words.

3.3 Word Embeddings
Dense vectors such as Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText.
Capture semantic similarity.

3.4 Contextual Embeddings
Transformer-based models: BERT, RoBERTa.
Meaning depends on context; best performance today.

CLASSICAL MACHINE LEARNING MODELS

Used commonly with BoW or TF-IDF.

4.1 Naive Bayes
Simple and effective baseline; probabilistic model.

4.2 Logistic Regression
Strong performance with regularization.

4.3 Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Very effective for high-dimensional sparse data.

4.4 k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Instance-based; slower during prediction.

4.5 Decision Trees / Random Forests
Less effective for sparse high-dimensional text features.

NEURAL NETWORK MODELS

Useful for large datasets and capturing linguistic patterns.

5.1 Feedforward Neural Networks
Simple architecture over TF-IDF vectors.

5.2 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Capture n-gram patterns; popular for sentence classification.

5.3 RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs
Model sequential dependencies; used in sentiment analysis.

5.4 Transformers
State-of-the-art performance.
Pretrained models: BERT, DistilBERT, ALBERT.
Fine-tuned for classification tasks.

TRAINING PROCESS

Steps:
Data preprocessing (tokenization, normalization)
Feature extraction (TF-IDF or embeddings)
Train/test split
Model training
Evaluation using classification metrics

EVALUATION METRICS

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Confusion matrix
Micro/macro averaging (for multi-class and imbalanced datasets)
ROC-AUC (for binary classification)

APPLICATIONS

Spam filtering
Sentiment analysis
News categorization
Topic labeling
Toxic comment detection
Search engine query classification
Email routing
Recommendation filters
Social media monitoring
Customer support automation

CHALLENGES

High dimensionality
Synonymy and polysemy
Imbalanced classes
Domain shift
Sarcasm and figurative language
Multilingual and noisy data

MODERN TRENDS

Pretrained transformers with fine-tuning
Zero-shot classification (LLM-based)
Prompt-based classification
Lightweight transformer variants for deployment

Summary

Text classification assigns correct labels to documents by converting text into numerical features and using ML or DL models. Classical models (Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression) work well with TF-IDF, while deep learning and transformers achieve state-of-the-art performance, especially for semantic-rich tasks.
