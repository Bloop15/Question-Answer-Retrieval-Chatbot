LINK ANALYSIS (PAGERANK & HITS)

Link analysis algorithms help rank web pages using hyperlink structure. They treat links as votes of importance. The two main algorithms are PageRank and HITS.

WHY LINK ANALYSIS?

Keywords alone cannot determine page importance. Links help capture:
• Authority
• Popularity
• Trustworthiness
• Topic relevance

If many important pages link to a page, it is likely important.

THE WEB GRAPH

The web is viewed as a directed graph:
• Nodes: Web pages
• Edges: Hyperlinks

Link direction A → B means A links to B.

PAGERANK (GOOGLE)

PageRank measures global importance of pages using link structure.

Basic idea: A page is important if important pages link to it.

3.1 PageRank Formula

For a page A:
PR(A) = (1 − d)/N + d * Σ ( PR(B) / OutDegree(B) )

Where:
• N = total number of pages
• d = damping factor (≈ 0.85)
• The sum is over all pages B that link to A

Components:
• (1-d)/N : random jump probability
• Remaining term: link-based authority from neighbors

PAGERANK INTUITION

• A link is a vote
• Votes from important pages weigh more
• Pages with many outgoing links divide their vote

PAGERANK CALCULATION

Initialization:
PR(A) = 1/N for all pages

Then iteratively apply the formula until convergence.
Implemented using power iteration or sparse matrix operations.

HANDLING SINK NODES

Sink = page with no outgoing links.
Solution: redistribute its rank evenly across all pages (via damping factor).

SIMPLE EXAMPLE

A → B
B → C
C → A

All pages end up with:
PR(A) = PR(B) = PR(C) = 1/3

STRENGTHS OF PAGERANK

• Captures global popularity
• Harder to manipulate than simple metrics
• Useful for large-scale ranking

LIMITATIONS OF PAGERANK

• Still vulnerable to link farms/spam
• Not topic-sensitive
• Slow global updates
• Requires combination with other ranking signals

HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search)

HITS assigns two scores to each page:
• Authority: a page referenced by good hubs
• Hub: a page linking to good authorities

Good hubs link to good authorities, and vice-versa.

HITS SCORES

Authority score:
A(p) = Σ H(q), for pages q linking to p

Hub score:
H(p) = Σ A(r), for pages r that p links to

HITS ALGORITHM

Initialize all A(p) = 1, H(p) = 1

Update all authorities

Update all hubs

Normalize scores

Repeat until convergence

Produces:
• Ranked authority list
• Ranked hub list

SIMPLE EXAMPLE

A → B, C
B → C
C → B

B and C become strong authorities.
A becomes a strong hub.

PROPERTIES OF HITS
Advantages
• Topic-sensitive (computed per query)
• Separates authority from hub roles

Disadvantages
• Spam-sensitive
• Expensive at query time
• Topic drift due to subgraph noise

PAGERANK vs HITS

Feature	PageRank	HITS
Focus	Global importance	Topic-specific authority/hub
Computation	Offline (batch)	At query time
Scores	Single score	Two scores (A & H)
Spam resistance	Higher	Lower
Used by	Google (early)	Specialized search, research

MODERN USAGE

Search engines combine link analysis with:
• BM25 and other lexical scoring
• Click models
• Machine-learned ranking
• Neural models such as BERT
• Freshness and behavioral signals

PageRank and HITS remain foundational concepts in ranking.

Summary

PageRank ranks pages by the importance of linking pages and is used as a global authority measure. HITS assigns authority and hub scores, useful for topic-focused ranking but more spam-sensitive. Both algorithms leverage web graph structure to improve search relevance.
