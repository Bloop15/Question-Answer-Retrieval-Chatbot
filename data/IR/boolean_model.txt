BOOLEAN MODEL IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL

The Boolean Model is one of the earliest and simplest Information Retrieval (IR) models.
It is based on Boolean logic and retrieves documents using logical operators: AND, OR, NOT.
Documents are either retrieved or not retrieved. There is no ranking.

Basic Idea

Documents and query terms are binary: either present or absent.
A document is retrieved only if it satisfies the Boolean query condition.
Output is a binary decision: Relevant (1) or Not Relevant (0).

Boolean Operators

2.1 AND
Retrieves documents containing all query terms.
Example:
machine AND learning → returns only documents with both terms.

2.2 OR
Retrieves documents containing at least one term.
Example:
ai OR ml → returns documents containing either term.

2.3 NOT
Excludes documents containing a term.
Example:
database NOT sql → returns database-related documents excluding sql.

Representation

Documents are represented as sets of terms after preprocessing.
Example:
D1 = {machine, learning, algorithm}
D2 = {deep, learning, neural}
Query: machine AND learning
D1 is retrieved, D2 is not.

Retrieval Process

Boolean queries are evaluated using inverted indexes.
Example inverted index:

Term | Posting List
machine | {D1, D3, D7}
learning | {D1, D2, D3, D6}

Query: machine AND learning
Result: intersection → {D1, D3}

Query Examples

(apple OR banana) AND NOT mango
("information retrieval" AND indexing) OR search
(artificial AND intelligence) AND (ml OR ai) NOT robotics

Advantages

Simple and fast
Based on clear set logic
Good for expert users
Effective for precise queries
Works well with inverted index structure

Limitations

No ranking or scoring
Exact match only
Difficult to form good queries
Can lead to low recall or low precision depending on operators
No term weighting (all terms equal)

Extensions of Boolean Model

Extended Boolean Model: supports term weights and ranking
Fuzzy Boolean Model: allows partial relevance (degrees of match)
Probabilistic Boolean variants: probabilistic scoring on Boolean queries

Use Cases

Useful for legal, patent, medical searching
Cases where exact control is needed
Small document collections

Not suitable for general web search due to lack of ranking and partial matching.
