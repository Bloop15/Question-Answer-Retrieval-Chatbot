TEXT CLUSTERING

Text clustering groups similar documents without using labeled data. It is an unsupervised learning approach used for document organization, topic discovery, search result clustering, summarization, and exploratory analysis.

WHAT IS TEXT CLUSTERING?

Given a document set D, clustering assigns documents into groups such that:

Documents in the same cluster are similar

Documents in different clusters are dissimilar

No predefined classes are given; the model discovers structure in the data.

TYPES OF TEXT CLUSTERING METHODS

2.1 Partition-Based Clustering

K-means is the most widely used method.

Process:

Convert documents to vectors (TF-IDF or embeddings)

Select number of clusters k

Assign documents to nearest centroid

Update centroids until convergence

Pros:

Fast and scalable

Works well for large datasets

Cons:

Must choose k beforehand

Sensitive to initialization

Best for spherical clusters

2.2 Hierarchical Clustering

Creates a tree of clusters (dendrogram).

Types:

Agglomerative: start from individual docs and merge

Divisive: start from one cluster and split

Distance options: single, complete, average linkage

Pros:

No need to predefine k

Good interpretability

Cons:

High complexity (O(n²))

Not ideal for very large corpora

2.3 Density-Based Clustering

DBSCAN groups documents that form dense regions.

Pros:

Can detect arbitrary shapes

Identifies noise/outliers

Cons:

Hard to tune parameters

Sparse high-dimensional TF-IDF data reduces effectiveness

2.4 Probabilistic Clustering

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models documents as mixtures of topics and topics as word distributions.

Pros:

Produces interpretable topics

Cons:

Sensitive to hyperparameters

Bag-of-words assumption

TEXT REPRESENTATION METHODS

3.1 TF-IDF Vectors
Sparse vectors suitable for K-means.

3.2 Word Embeddings
Dense semantic vectors (Word2Vec, GloVe). Document vectors can be averaged embeddings.

3.3 Sentence Embeddings
Best semantic representations for clustering:
SBERT, USE, MiniLM, MPNet

3.4 Document Embeddings
Doc2Vec and transformer-based document encoders.

CLUSTER EVALUATION METRICS

4.1 Internal Metrics
Used when true labels are not available.

Silhouette Score (higher is better)

Davies-Bouldin Index (lower is better)

4.2 External Metrics
Used when ground truth labels exist.

Purity

NMI (Normalized Mutual Information)

ARI (Adjusted Rand Index)

APPLICATIONS

Search result clustering
Topic discovery in news
Customer feedback grouping
Corpus exploration
Digital library organization
Recommender systems
Fraud or pattern detection
Market segmentation

CHALLENGES

High-dimensional sparse text vectors
Choosing correct number of clusters
Noise and outliers
Synonymy and polysemy
Interpreting cluster meaning
Scalability for large corpora
Parameter tuning in probabilistic or density methods

MODERN ADVANCES

7.1 BERT-based clustering using sentence embeddings
7.2 Spectral clustering for non-spherical clusters
7.3 Clustering in dense embedding space (DPR, ColBERT)
7.4 Top2Vec for automatic topic discovery

Summary

Text clustering organizes documents without labels by grouping similar documents together. Common methods include K-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, and topic modeling (LDA). Stronger semantic representations using SBERT or other embeddings significantly improve clustering quality and interpretability.
