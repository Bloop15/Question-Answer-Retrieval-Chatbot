LANGUAGE MODELS FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL (LMIR)

Language Models in IR estimate the probability that a document would generate the user’s query (Query Likelihood Model). LMIR is a probabilistic approach unlike heuristic models (TF-IDF, BM25).

BASIC IDEA OF LMIR

Each document has a language model defining a probability distribution over terms.

Ranking principle:
score(D | Q) = P(Q | D)

Documents with higher probability of generating the query are considered more relevant.

QUERY LIKELIHOOD MODEL

Assume query terms are independent:
P(Q | D) = Π P(qi | D)

MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATE (MLE)

P(t | D) = TF(t, D) / |D|

Problem: P becomes 0 if term does not appear in the document. Smoothing is required.

SMOOTHING TECHNIQUES

Prevent zero probabilities; combine document and collection statistics.

4.1 Laplace Smoothing
P(t | D) = (TF(t, D) + 1) / (|D| + V)
V = vocabulary size
Rarely used in IR (over-smoothing)

4.2 Jelinek-Mercer (JM) Smoothing
P(t | D) = (1 − λ) P_MLE(t | D) + λ P(t | C)
λ typically 0.1–0.4
Interpolates document and collection models

4.3 Dirichlet Prior Smoothing
P(t | D) = (TF(t, D) + μ P(t | C)) / (|D| + μ)
μ ≈ 2000 (common value)
Balances term probability based on document length
Most widely used method in search engines

COLLECTION LANGUAGE MODEL (CLM)

P(t | C) = total_count(t) / total_terms_in_collection

Provides background probability for terms across the corpus.

DOCUMENT SCORE COMPUTATION

For query Q = {q1, q2, …, qk}:
score(D | Q) = Σ log P(qi | D)
Logs prevent numerical underflow.

ADVANTAGES OF LMIR

Probabilistic foundation
Accounts for term frequency and collection statistics
Handles zero probability via smoothing
Often works well for short queries

LIMITATIONS OF LMIR

Bag-of-words assumption
No semantic similarity
Cannot resolve synonyms and polysemy
Performance drops for long queries

EXTENSIONS OF LMIR

9.1 Relevance Models (RM1/RM2)
Used in pseudo relevance feedback for query expansion

9.2 Query Expansion
Enhances vocabulary matching

9.3 Translation Models
P(q | D) = Σ P(q | t) P(t | D)
Handles vocabulary mismatch

9.4 Topic Models (LDA)
Better document representation for retrieval

NEURAL LANGUAGE MODELS IN IR

Modern IR uses neural semantic models:

10.1 Word2Vec / GloVe
Dense vector embeddings for semantic similarity

10.2 Transformers (BERT)
Contextual representations, reranking

10.3 DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval)
Vector-space retrieval via embedding similarity

10.4 ColBERT
Late interaction, efficient reranking

10.5 SPLADE
Sparse transformer suitable for indexing and fast retrieval

COMPARISON: LMIR vs BM25 vs Neural IR

Feature | LMIR | BM25 | Neural IR
Type | Probabilistic | Heuristic | Deep Semantic
Scoring | Query likelihood | TF normalization | Embedding similarity
Strength | Strong theory | Practical strong performance | Semantic understanding
Weakness | No semantics | Heuristic assumptions | High computational cost

Summary

LMIR ranks documents by the probability of generating the query. It uses smoothing (JM, Dirichlet) to avoid zero probabilities and integrates both document and collection statistics. LMIR is a foundational IR model from which modern neural retrieval approaches evolved.
