WEB SEARCH ENGINES
Web search engines are large-scale Information Retrieval systems used to search the web and return relevant ranked results. They contain components such as crawling, document processing, indexing, ranking, query processing, and distributed storage.

ARCHITECTURE
Three major subsystems:

Crawling System: collects web pages using automated bots.

Indexing System: processes extracted text and stores it in an inverted index.

Query Processing System: handles user queries, retrieves and ranks documents.

WEB CRAWLING
A crawler (spider/bot) downloads pages by following hyperlinks.
Steps:

Seed URLs: initial starting list

URL Frontier: queue of URLs to fetch

Fetching: downloading page content

Parsing: extracting text, metadata, and links

Link expansion: discovered URLs added to the frontier
Challenges include infinite/dynamic web, duplicate pages, handling robots.txt, politeness policies, crawler traps.

DOCUMENT PROCESSING
Before indexing, documents undergo cleaning and normalization:

HTML removal, boilerplate removal

Tokenization, normalization

Stemming or lemmatization

Language detection

Metadata extraction

Duplicate detection using techniques like shingling and MinHash

INDEXING
Search engines maintain huge inverted indexes distributed across many servers.
Index stores:

Terms and posting lists

Document IDs

Term frequencies

Anchor text

Page metadata such as PageRank score
Distributed indexing uses MapReduce, SPIMI, and LSM-tree storage. Compression methods like variable byte coding and Golomb coding reduce size.

QUERY PROCESSING
Steps during a search:

Query parsing: tokenization, spell correction, query suggestion, entity recognition, query expansion

Candidate retrieval: using inverted index

Ranking: calculates scores using models such as BM25, neural ranking models (e.g., BERT), link analysis scores, freshness, click data, personalization
Top-k ranked documents returned to user.

LINK ANALYSIS
Two major algorithms:

PageRank: computes global importance based on inbound links and their weights.

HITS: computes both authority score (importance) and hub score (linking to good pages).

RANKING SIGNALS
Signals used for ranking include:

On-page: title, headings, keywords, URL structure

Off-page: backlinks, anchor text

User behavior: click-through rate, dwell time

Freshness: newer pages for time-sensitive topics

Personalization: location, search history

AUTOCOMPLETE AND QUERY SUGGESTION
Uses query logs, language models, and popularity trends to help users refine queries.

WEB-SCALE STORAGE
Distributed file systems and databases used:
GFS, HDFS, Bigtable, Spanner
Indexes are sharded and replicated for speed and fault tolerance.

ADVERTISING SYSTEMS
Search engines run sponsored search markets such as Google Ads. Ranking uses auction models like Generalized Second Price combined with quality score.

EVALUATION
Evaluation metrics include Precision@k, Recall@k, MAP, and NDCG. User interaction data is used to refine ranking.

CHALLENGES
Large scale, continuously changing content, spam, multilingual data, multimedia indexing, and strict latency requirements.

SUMMARY
Web search engines rely on large-scale crawling, efficient indexing, advanced ranking models, link analysis, distributed systems, and behavioral signals to provide fast and relevant search results.
