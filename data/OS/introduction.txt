CHAPTER 1 — INTRODUCTION TO OPERATING SYSTEMS

(Clean, concise, RAG-optimized summary)

An Operating System (OS) is a program that manages the resources of a computer and provides an interface between users/applications and hardware. It acts as a resource manager, extended machine, and control program.

=========================================================
1. WHAT IS AN OPERATING SYSTEM?
=========================================================

An OS is software that controls hardware and provides essential services to applications.
Key responsibilities:

Manage CPU, memory, storage, I/O devices

Provide abstraction of hardware (files, processes, sockets)

Enforce protection and security

Schedule processes and allocate resources

Handle communication among processes

=========================================================
2. COMPUTER HARDWARE OVERVIEW
=========================================================

OS interacts with hardware components:

2.1 CPU

Executes instructions

Runs in kernel mode (OS) or user mode (applications)

2.2 Memory

Contains running programs and OS kernel

Managed through paging, segmentation

2.3 I/O Devices

Disks, SSDs, keyboards, network cards

Controlled via device controllers and device drivers

2.4 Buses

Communication paths between CPU, memory, and devices.

=========================================================
3. OPERATING SYSTEM AS A RESOURCE MANAGER
=========================================================

OS coordinates resource usage:

CPU scheduling

Memory allocation

Disk & file management

I/O device handling

Goal → maximize performance, fairness, efficiency, and reliability.

=========================================================
4. OPERATING SYSTEM AS AN EXTENDED MACHINE
=========================================================

Raw hardware is complex.
The OS abstracts it into simple, usable units:

Hardware → OS → Applications
Examples:

Hardware sectors → files

Instruction sets → system calls

DMA/I/O devices → virtualized device interfaces

=========================================================
5. SYSTEM CALLS
=========================================================

System calls are the API between user programs and OS.

Categories:

Process control

File management

Device management

Memory management

Information maintenance

Communication

System calls use a trap instruction to switch to kernel mode.

=========================================================
6. TYPES OF OPERATING SYSTEMS
=========================================================
6.1 Mainframe OS

Supports high-throughput batch jobs and transactions.

6.2 Server OS

For multiuser, networked systems (Linux, Windows Server).

6.3 Multiprocessor OS

Supports multi-core CPUs, symmetric multiprocessing (SMP).

6.4 Personal Computer OS

Desktop systems (Windows, macOS, Linux distributions).

6.5 Mobile OS

Android, iOS.

6.6 Embedded OS

Minimalistic systems for appliances, IoT devices.

6.7 Real-Time OS

Guarantees deadlines (hard/soft real time).

=========================================================
7. OS STRUCTURES
=========================================================
7.1 Monolithic Systems

Entire OS runs in kernel mode.
Fast but less modular.

7.2 Layered Systems

OS built in layers (hardware → apps).
Better structure, slower.

7.3 Microkernels

Minimal kernel; services run in user space.
More modular and secure, slightly slower.

7.4 Modular Kernels

Combination of monolithic + microkernel (Linux loadable modules).

7.5 Virtual Machines

Provide fully virtualized hardware environments.

=========================================================
8. VIRTUALIZATION
=========================================================

OS can run inside another OS via a hypervisor.

Types:

Type 1 (bare-metal): VMware ESXi, Hyper-V

Type 2 (hosted): VirtualBox

Benefits:

Isolation

Testing multiple OSes

Efficient server utilization

=========================================================
9. PROCESS CONCEPT
=========================================================

Process = program in execution, with:

Program counter

Registers

Address space

Open files

Resources

OS provides:

Creation

Termination

Scheduling

Interprocess communication

(This will be explored deeply in Chapter 2.)

=========================================================
10. DESIGN ISSUES
=========================================================
10.1 Interrupts & Exceptions

Hardware signals to OS for asynchronous events.

10.2 Protection

Prevent processes from interfering with one another.

10.3 Reliability

Fault tolerance, error handling.

10.4 Performance

Throughput, latency, resource utilization.

=========================================================
11. BOOTING THE COMPUTER
=========================================================

Steps:

CPU starts in firmware (BIOS/UEFI)

Loads bootloader

Bootloader loads OS kernel into memory

OS initializes hardware & starts system processes

=========================================================
12. HISTORY OF OPERATING SYSTEMS (Very Short)
=========================================================

1940s–50s: Batch systems

1960s: Multiprogramming, time-sharing

1970s: UNIX revolution

1980s: PCs, MS-DOS, MacOS

1990s: NT kernel, Linux

2000s+: Mobile OS, virtualization, cloud systems

Summary

The OS is a fundamental part of every computer system, acting as a resource manager, extended machine, and control program. It abstracts hardware complexity, enforces protection, manages processes and memory, and provides essential system services. Understanding its structure sets the foundation for chapters on processes, memory, file systems, and multiprocessor systems.
