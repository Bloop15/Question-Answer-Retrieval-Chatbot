CHAPTER 9 — SECURITY

Security is a critical part of modern operating systems.
It ensures that data, users, and system resources remain protected against unauthorized access, attacks, and failures.

Operating system security provides:

Confidentiality (data is protected)

Integrity (data is accurate and unaltered)

Availability (system remains usable)

These form the classic CIA triad.

=========================================================
1. THREATS & ATTACKS
=========================================================

A threat is a potential danger; an attack is an attempt to exploit it.

Common threat categories:

Information theft (passwords, private data)

Espionage

Vandalism (malware, ransomware)

Denial of Service (DoS)

Privilege escalation

Attack types:

Passive attacks → eavesdropping

Active attacks → altering data, impersonation

=========================================================
2. MALWARE
=========================================================

Malware includes:

2.1 Viruses

Self-replicating code attached to files.

2.2 Worms

Self-replicating across networks without user action.

2.3 Trojans

Malicious software disguised as legitimate programs.

2.4 Ransomware

Encrypts data and demands payment.

2.5 Spyware & Keyloggers

Stealth data collection.

2.6 Rootkits

Hide presence of malware by altering the OS.

=========================================================
3. DEFENSE MECHANISMS
=========================================================

Security relies on layered defense:

3.1 Authentication

Verify user identity.

Methods:

Passwords

Biometrics

Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Certificates

3.2 Authorization

Control access to resources using:

Permissions

Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Capabilities

3.3 Encryption

Protect data confidentiality.

Types:

Symmetric (AES)

Asymmetric (RSA, ECC)

Hashing (SHA-256)

Applications:

Disk encryption

Secure communication (TLS/SSL)

3.4 Auditing & Logging

Track system activity for detection and analysis.

=========================================================
4. ACCESS CONTROL MODELS
=========================================================
4.1 DAC — Discretionary Access Control

Access rights managed by users.
Example: UNIX file permissions.

4.2 MAC — Mandatory Access Control

OS enforces policies based on confidentiality labels.
Used in:

Military systems

SELinux

4.3 RBAC — Role-Based Access Control

Permissions assigned to roles, not users.
Common in enterprise systems.

=========================================================
5. BUFFER OVERFLOWS & MEMORY ATTACKS
=========================================================

Classic exploit: exceeding boundaries of a buffer to overwrite memory, modify return addresses, or inject shellcode.

Defenses:

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)

Stack canaries

Non-executable stack (NX bit)

Compiler checks (Fortify, stack protection)

=========================================================
6. SOFTWARE SECURITY VULNERABILITIES
=========================================================
6.1 Race Conditions

TOCTOU (time-of-check to time-of-use) errors.

6.2 Integer Overflows

Used to bypass bounds checks.

6.3 Format String Attacks

Exploiting uncontrolled printf format specifiers.

6.4 Code Injection

Script injection, SQL injection, command injection.

=========================================================
7. PRINCIPLE OF LEAST PRIVILEGE
=========================================================

Processes should run with minimum necessary rights.

Applies to:

File permissions

User accounts

Services/daemons

Containers

Virtual machines

Reduces attack surface.

=========================================================
8. KERNEL SECURITY
=========================================================

Kernel-mode attacks are severe.

Common strategies:

Kernel code signing

Isolating drivers

Minimizing attack surface

Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

Hypervisor protection

Linux uses:

SELinux

AppArmor

Windows uses:

Secure Boot

Device Guard

=========================================================
9. NETWORK SECURITY
=========================================================

Many attacks originate from the network.

Tools:

Firewalls (packet filters/stateful inspection)

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

VPNs

TLS/SSL

Example network threats:

MITM attacks

ARP spoofing

DNS poisoning

SYN flooding

=========================================================
10. WEB SECURITY
=========================================================

Common web threats:

Cross-site scripting (XSS)

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

SQL injection

Session hijacking

Mitigations:

Input validation

Output escaping

Secure cookies

CSP headers

=========================================================
11. PHYSICAL SECURITY
=========================================================

Protect hardware from:

Theft

Tampering

Eavesdropping

Techniques:

Locks

Secure enclosures

Surveillance

Hardware encryption modules

=========================================================
12. SECURITY POLICIES AND PRACTICES
=========================================================

Every organization needs:

Security policy

Incident response plan

Regular audits

Employee training

Patch management

Human factors often the weakest link.

=========================================================
13. VIRTUALIZATION & CLOUD SECURITY
=========================================================

Unique risks:

VM escape

Hypervisor attacks

Side-channel leakage

Multi-tenant data exposure

Mitigation:

Hardware virtualization extensions

VM isolation

Secure hypervisors

Encrypted data at rest & in memory

Summary

Security is a multi-layered discipline involving authentication, authorization, malware defense, memory safety, access control models, kernel protections, and network/web security.
OS security ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability while defending against evolving threats and vulnerabilities.
