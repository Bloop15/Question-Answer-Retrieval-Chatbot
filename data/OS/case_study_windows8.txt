CHAPTER 11 — CASE STUDY: WINDOWS 8

Windows 8 is a modern operating system designed by Microsoft with a hybrid kernel architecture, strong focus on backward compatibility, extensive driver support, and a redesigned UI (Metro).
This chapter covers its architecture, process/thread model, memory management, file systems, security, and I/O subsystems.

=========================================================
1. WINDOWS 8 ARCHITECTURE
=========================================================

Windows uses a hybrid kernel, blending microkernel and monolithic concepts.

Kernel components:

Executive

Kernel

HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)

Device drivers

Windowing system

Windows architecture is layered for portability and robustness.

=========================================================
2. SYSTEM COMPONENTS
=========================================================
✔ 2.1 Executive (Kernel Mode)

Handles:

Object management

Process, thread management

Virtual memory

I/O manager

Security

✔ 2.2 Kernel

Low-level tasks:

Scheduling

Synchronization

Trap handling

✔ 2.3 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)

Abstracts hardware details so Windows runs on varied devices without modification.

✔ 2.4 User Mode Subsystems

Win32 subsystem (core apps)

Windows Store apps subsystem (Metro)

.NET runtime

POSIX subsystem (removed in Win8)

=========================================================
3. WINDOWS OBJECT MANAGER
=========================================================

Windows treats everything as an object.

Objects include:

Files

Threads

Processes

Registry keys

Named pipes

Mutexes

Events

Objects have:

Names

Security descriptors

Reference counts

Methods

Objects stored in hierarchical object namespaces.

=========================================================
4. PROCESS AND THREAD MANAGEMENT
=========================================================
✔ Processes

Windows processes contain:

Virtual address space

Handle table

Security token

Threads

✔ Threads

Scheduling unit in Windows.

Attributes include:

Thread ID

Registers

Stack

Priority

4.1 Scheduling

Windows uses a priority-based preemptive scheduler.

Priorities:

0–15: variable classes

16–31: real-time classes

Scheduler features:

Quantum-based time slicing

Priority boosting

Priority inversion defenses

=========================================================
5. MEMORY MANAGEMENT
=========================================================

Windows uses a demand-paged virtual memory system.

5.1 Virtual Address Space (VAS)

Divided into:

Kernel space (shared)

User space (per process)

5.2 Page Tables

Windows supports:

Page directories

Page tables

Large pages

Copy-on-write

5.3 Working Set

Each process has a working set:

Subset of pages currently in memory

Managed by working set manager

=========================================================
6. FILE SYSTEMS IN WINDOWS
=========================================================
✔ NTFS (New Technology File System)

Primary FS, supports:

Journaling

Access control lists (ACLs)

Encryption (EFS)

Compression

Sparse files

Hard links / junctions

Master File Table (MFT)

✔ ReFS (Resilient File System)

Designed for:

High reliability

Auto-correction using checksums

✔ FAT32/exFAT

Used for removable media.

=========================================================
7. WINDOWS REGISTRY
=========================================================

The registry stores:

OS configuration

Application settings

Driver information

User preferences

Organized into hives and keys.

=========================================================
8. I/O SYSTEM & DEVICE DRIVERS
=========================================================

Windows uses a layered driver model:

✔ Highest → Lowest:

User-mode drivers

Kernel-mode drivers

HAL

I/O subsystem includes:

Plug and Play manager

Power manager

I/O request packets (IRPs)

Device stacks

Windows uses I/O completion ports for high-performance servers.

=========================================================
9. WINDOWS SECURITY MODEL
=========================================================

Security features:

✔ Access Tokens

Store:

User SID

Group SIDs

Privileges

Attached to each process/thread.

✔ Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Define permissions on objects.

Two types:

DACL (Discretionary)

SACL (Auditing)

✔ Integrity Levels

Protect against privilege escalation.

✔ Secure Boot

Ensures OS integrity at startup.

✔ BitLocker

Provides full-disk encryption.

=========================================================
10. WINDOWS NETWORKING
=========================================================

Networking stack includes:

Winsock

TCP/IP

SMB (file sharing)

Firewalls

VPNs

Windows integrates:

IPv4 & IPv6

QoS

Network Access Protection (NAP)

=========================================================
11. WINDOWS SERVICES
=========================================================

Background daemons in Windows.

Features:

Run under various user accounts

Can auto-start on boot

Controlled by SCM (Service Control Manager)

Examples:

Windows Update

Print Spooler

DNS Client

Security Center

=========================================================
12. METRO UI (WINDOWS 8 SPECIFIC)
=========================================================

Windows 8 introduced:

Tile-based interface

Charm bar

Windows Store apps

Sandboxed app containers

Store apps run with strict permissions.

=========================================================
13. DIFFERENCES: WINDOWS VS UNIX/LINUX
=========================================================
Feature	Windows	UNIX/Linux
Kernel	Hybrid	Monolithic / Hybrid
Permissions	ACLs	rwx model
System calls	Win32 API	POSIX
IPC	Named pipes, COM	Pipes, signals, sockets
Default FS	NTFS	ext4/XFS
Registry	Yes	No (text-based configs)
GUI	Integrated	Optional (X/Wayland)
Summary

Windows 8 is a hybrid-kernel OS with a strong emphasis on compatibility, security, and modularity.
It uses advanced systems like NTFS, ACL-based security, I/O request packets, working-set–based memory management, and object-based kernel architecture.
The Metro UI and integrated app container model distinguish Windows 8 from classical desktop systems.
