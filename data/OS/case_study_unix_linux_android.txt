CHAPTER 10 — CASE STUDY: UNIX, LINUX, AND ANDROID

This chapter explores real-world operating systems—UNIX, Linux, and Android—focusing on their architecture, design principles, process management, file systems, security, and system calls.

=========================================================
1. UNIX ARCHITECTURE & PHILOSOPHY
=========================================================

UNIX pioneered many OS concepts still used today.

Key design principles:

Everything is a file

Simplicity (“Do one thing well”)

Composability (pipes, filters)

Hierarchical file system

Portable, written mostly in C

1.1 UNIX Architecture

User space programs

Kernel handling processes, files, devices

System calls providing interface

1.2 System Calls in UNIX

Common system calls:

fork()

exec()

open, read, write, close

wait()

kill()

UNIX system calls are minimal and elegant.

=========================================================
2. UNIX PROCESS MANAGEMENT
=========================================================

Processes are central to UNIX design.

✔ fork()

Creates a child process (copy of parent).

✔ exec()

Replaces process memory with a new program.

✔ wait()

Parent waits for child termination.

✔ Signals

Used for asynchronous events (SIGINT, SIGKILL, etc.).

=========================================================
3. UNIX FILE SYSTEM
=========================================================

UNIX uses a multi-layered FS based on inodes.

Features:

Hierarchical directory tree

Regular files, directories, device files

Hard links & symbolic links

Permissions: rwx for owner/group/others

=========================================================
4. LINUX — OVERVIEW
=========================================================

Linux is a UNIX-like, POSIX-compliant, open-source OS.

Characteristics:

Monolithic kernel with loadable modules

Portability (supports hundreds of devices)

Widely used in servers, cloud, embedded systems

Community-driven development

=========================================================
5. LINUX KERNEL ARCHITECTURE
=========================================================

Linux kernel is monolithic, but modular.

Modules:

Device drivers

File systems

Networking stack

Memory manager

Scheduler

System call interface

Modules can be loaded/unloaded dynamically.

=========================================================
6. LINUX PROCESS MANAGEMENT
=========================================================

Linux uses:

A task struct to store PCB

Preemptive, priority-based scheduling

CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) as default

Process creation:

fork() + exec() (like UNIX)

clone() for lightweight processes (threads)

=========================================================
7. LINUX FILE SYSTEMS
=========================================================

Linux supports many file systems:

ext2/ext3/ext4

Journaling

Extents

Large file support

XFS

High-performance, scalable FS.

Btrfs

Advanced FS with:

Snapshots

Checksums

Built-in RAID

procfs & sysfs

Virtual FSes for system information.

=========================================================
8. LINUX SECURITY
=========================================================

Linux security tools:

SELinux (Mandatory Access Control)

AppArmor (profile-based security)

Capabilities (break up root privileges)

iptables/nftables firewall

Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)

=========================================================
9. ANDROID — INTRODUCTION
=========================================================

Android is a Linux-based mobile OS developed by Google.

Design goals:

Touch-based interface

App ecosystem (APK packages)

Energy-efficient

Secure sandboxing of apps

9.1 Android Architecture (Layers)
✔ Layer 1 — Linux Kernel

Process & thread management

Memory management

Drivers (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Binder IPC)

✔ Layer 2 — Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Standard interface for hardware vendors.

✔ Layer 3 — Android Runtime (ART)

Runs apps

Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation

Garbage collection

✔ Layer 4 — Libraries & Framework

SQLite

WebKit

Media codecs

UI toolkit

✔ Layer 5 — Applications layer

Apps written in Java/Kotlin.

=========================================================
10. ANDROID SECURITY MODEL
=========================================================
✔ Application Sandbox

Each app runs as a unique user ID.

✔ Permissions System

Apps must request explicit permissions.

✔ Verified Boot

Ensures OS not tampered with.

✔ SELinux Enforced Mode

Strict security policies for all apps.

=========================================================
11. ANDROID FILE SYSTEM
=========================================================

Android uses:

ext4 → system & data partitions

F2FS → optimized for flash storage

File structure:

/system → OS libraries

/data → apps & user data

/sdcard → media

=========================================================
12. BINDER IPC SYSTEM (ANDROID)
=========================================================

Binder is Android’s core interprocess communication mechanism.

Features:

Efficient

Secure

Supports remote method calls

Handles reference counting

Used for communication between:

Activities

Services

System services

=========================================================
13. PACKAGE MANAGEMENT
=========================================================

APK packages contain:

App code

Resources

Manifest (permissions)

Signatures

Android verifies signatures before installation.

=========================================================
14. APP LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT
=========================================================

Apps move through states:

Active

Paused

Stopped

Destroyed

OS kills background apps under memory pressure.

=========================================================
15. COMPARISON: UNIX vs LINUX vs ANDROID
=========================================================
Feature	UNIX	Linux	Android
Kernel	Monolithic	Monolithic + modules	Linux-based
UI	CLI	CLI/GUI	Touch GUI
Apps	Native C	Native C/ELF	APK Java/Kotlin
Security	Simple	Advanced (SELinux)	Strong sandbox
IPC	Pipes, signals	Same + extras	Binder IPC
Summary

UNIX introduced core OS concepts; Linux extended them with modularity, performance, and open-source development.
Android builds on Linux to provide a secure, mobile-oriented platform with sandboxing, Binder IPC, and a tailored application runtime.
