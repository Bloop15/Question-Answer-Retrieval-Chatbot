A data model defines how data is structured, organized, and manipulated in a database. It specifies the logical structure, semantics, constraints, and operations on data.

Purpose of Data Models:
Clarify data requirements
Support effective design
Ensure consistency and avoid redundancy
Define valid operations
Improve communication between designers and users

Components of a Data Model:
Structural component: how data is organized
Manipulation component: operations such as insert, update, delete, query
Integrity rules: constraints to maintain correctness

Types of Data Models:

Object-Based Data Models

a) Entity–Relationship (ER) Model:
Uses entities, attributes, and relationships
Used at conceptual design level

b) Enhanced ER (EER) Model:
Adds specialization, generalization, inheritance, aggregation
Used for complex systems

Record-Based Data Models

a) Hierarchical Model:
Tree structure (parent–child, one parent per child)
Fast for 1-to-many
Not suitable for many-to-many; rigid structure

b) Network Model:
Graph-based structure with links
Supports many-to-many
More flexible but complex to design and navigate

c) Relational Model:
Tables (relations) with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes)
Based on set theory and relational algebra
Simple, flexible, strong theoretical foundation
Most widely used model in DBMS

Object-Based Data Models (OODBMS):
Uses objects, classes, methods, inheritance
Useful for multimedia, CAD, and real-time systems

Object–Relational Model (ORDBMS):
Hybrid of relational + object models
Supports user-defined and complex data types
Used in PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server

Semi-Structured and NoSQL Models:

a) Key-Value stores: Redis, DynamoDB
b) Document model (JSON/XML): MongoDB
c) Column-family model: Cassandra, HBase
d) Graph model (nodes and edges): Neo4j

Schema and Instance:
Schema: overall database design (static)
Instance: data at a point in time (dynamic)

Levels of Data Abstraction:
Physical level: disk storage structures
Logical level: tables, relationships
View level: user-specific views
Supports data independence

Data Independence:
Logical independence: logical changes do not affect views
Physical independence: storage changes do not affect logical schema

Integrity Constraints:
Domain constraints
Key constraints
Entity integrity
Referential integrity

Summary:
Data models define representation and manipulation of data in DBMS. Major types include hierarchical, network, relational, object, and NoSQL models. Understanding schemas, abstraction levels, and integrity rules is essential for consistent and efficient database design.
