NORMALIZATION AND SCHEMA REFINEMENT

Normalization is a process for organizing relational database tables to reduce redundancy and prevent anomalies such as update, insert, and delete anomalies.
Schema refinement ensures an efficient, consistent, and logically correct structure based on functional dependencies and normal forms.

What Is Normalization?

Normalization decomposes relations into smaller, well-structured relations using:
• Functional dependencies
• Keys
• Attribute relationships

Goals:
• Reduce redundancy
• Remove anomalies
• Maintain consistency
• Improve schema clarity
• Support efficient updates

Anomalies Before Normalization

• Update anomaly: multiple updates required when one fact changes
• Insert anomaly: cannot insert certain data due to missing related data
• Delete anomaly: deleting data removes unintended information

Functional Dependencies

FD X → Y means:
If two tuples match on X, they must match on Y.
FDs are used to identify keys and detect design issues.

Normal Forms

4.1 First Normal Form (1NF)
Conditions:
• All attributes are atomic
• No repeating groups

4.2 Second Normal Form (2NF)
Conditions:
• In 1NF
• No partial dependency of non-key attributes on part of a composite key

Fix: Separate data dependent on only part of key.

4.3 Third Normal Form (3NF)
Conditions:
• In 2NF
• No transitive dependency of non-key attributes

Fix: Move transitive attributes to new relation.

4.4 Boyce–Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
Conditions:
• For every FD X → Y, X must be a superkey

Stronger than 3NF. Removes all FD-based anomalies.

4.5 Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
Conditions:
• In BCNF
• No non-trivial multivalued dependencies unless determinant is a superkey

Used when attributes contain independent multi-valued information.

4.6 Fifth Normal Form (5NF)
Conditions:
• No decomposition needed to preserve data
• Handles complex join dependencies

Rarely needed in practice.

Decomposition Principles

5.1 Lossless Join
Decomposition must allow full reconstruction of original relation.

5.2 Dependency Preservation
All FDs must still be enforceable without joining relations.

Example Refinement Cases

• 2NF: Remove partial dependency
• 3NF: Remove transitive dependency
• BCNF: Ensure determinant is a superkey

Normalization step-by-step refines schema structure.

When Denormalization Is Used

Sometimes normalization is partially reversed for performance:
• Many read-heavy queries
• Too many joins decrease performance
• OLAP and analytic workloads

Trade-off:
• Better performance
• Risk of redundancy and anomalies

Summary

Normalization organizes data into well-structured relations using:
• 1NF → Remove repeating groups
• 2NF → Remove partial dependencies
• 3NF → Remove transitive dependencies
• BCNF → Full FD-based correctness
• 4NF and 5NF → Handle MVDs and join dependencies

Goal:
Maintain integrity, eliminate redundancy, and improve database reliability.
