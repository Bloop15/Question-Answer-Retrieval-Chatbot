Database security is the set of policies and mechanisms that protect a database from unauthorized access, misuse, attacks, corruption, and accidental loss. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of data.

Why Database Security Is Important:
Protects sensitive data (personal, financial, medical, business)
Ensures only authorized access
Prevents unauthorized modifications
Maintains data availability
Supports compliance requirements

Security Goals (CIA Triad):

Confidentiality:
Protect data from unauthorized access
Methods: authentication, access control, encryption

Integrity:
Ensure data accuracy and prevent unauthorized change
Methods: integrity constraints, hashing, audit trails

Availability:
Ensure authorized users can access data anytime
Methods: backups, replication, load balancing, DoS protection

Database Security Threats:
Unauthorized access
SQL injection
Malware and viruses
Insider attacks
Data leakage
Denial of service (DoS)
Credential theft and spoofing

Access Control Mechanisms:

Authentication:
Verifies user identity
Methods: passwords, OTP, biometrics, certificates

Authorization:
Defines what authenticated users can do

Models:
DAC: owner assigns permissions (GRANT, REVOKE)
MAC: enforced security levels; no user changes
RBAC: permissions assigned to roles; users assigned to roles (widely used)

Encryption:

Encryption at rest: protects stored files and backups
Encryption in transit: protects network data (SSL/TLS)
Column-level encryption: protects sensitive fields (e.g., passwords)

Hashing:
Used for password security
Examples: SHA-256, bcrypt, Argon2

Auditing and Monitoring:
Logs access and changes
Used for intrusion detection, compliance, and forensics

Backup and Recovery:
Ensures availability of data
Methods: full, incremental, differential backups, continuous archiving
Recovery: WAL, checkpoints, ARIES
Backups must be protected and encrypted

Database Hardening:
Remove unused accounts and services
Change default passwords
Apply security patches
Restrict remote access
Enable firewalls
Strong password and configuration policies

SQL Injection Prevention:
Use prepared statements
Validate inputs
Escape special characters
Limit privileges
Example:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?;

SQL Security Commands:
GRANT: give privileges
REVOKE: remove privileges
CREATE ROLE: define roles for RBAC

Security in Distributed Databases:
Challenges: multiple nodes, network exposure
Solutions: encryption, Kerberos, secure replication, federated identity

Security in Cloud Databases:
Risks: shared infrastructure, internet exposure
Measures: IAM roles, VPC isolation, KMS encryption, database firewalls, zero trust

Summary:
Database security protects data while ensuring proper access and availability. It includes authentication, authorization, encryption, auditing, backups, system hardening, and defenses against common attacks such as SQL injection.
