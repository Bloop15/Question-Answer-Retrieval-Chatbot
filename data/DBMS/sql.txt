SQL — Structured Query Language

SQL is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. It is declarative: users specify what result they want, and the DBMS determines how to retrieve it.

SQL Sub-Languages:
• DDL – Data Definition Language
• DML – Data Manipulation Language
• DQL – Data Query Language
• DCL – Data Control Language
• TCL – Transaction Control Language

Data Definition Language (DDL)

Used to define and modify database schema.

1.1 CREATE
Create database:
CREATE DATABASE college;

Create table:
CREATE TABLE Student (
RollNo INT PRIMARY KEY,
Name VARCHAR(50),
Branch VARCHAR(20),
GPA DECIMAL(3,2)
);

1.2 ALTER
Add column:
ALTER TABLE Student ADD Email VARCHAR(50);

Modify column:
ALTER TABLE Student MODIFY GPA DECIMAL(4,2);

Drop column:
ALTER TABLE Student DROP COLUMN Email;

1.3 DROP
Removes a table permanently:
DROP TABLE Student;

1.4 TRUNCATE
Removes all rows but keeps structure:
TRUNCATE TABLE Student;

Data Manipulation Language (DML)

Used to insert, update, and delete data.

2.1 INSERT
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (101, 'Asha', 'CSE', 9.1);

Insert selective columns:
INSERT INTO Student (RollNo, Name) VALUES (102, 'John');

2.2 UPDATE
UPDATE Student
SET GPA = 9.5
WHERE RollNo = 101;

2.3 DELETE
DELETE FROM Student WHERE RollNo = 102;

Data Query Language (DQL)

3.1 SELECT
Retrieve all:
SELECT * FROM Student;

Filter:
SELECT Name, GPA FROM Student WHERE Branch = 'CSE';

Sort:
SELECT * FROM Student ORDER BY GPA DESC;

Limit:
SELECT * FROM Student LIMIT 5;

SQL Operators

Comparison: = , != , < , > , <= , >=
Logical: AND, OR, NOT
Range: BETWEEN
Set: IN, NOT IN
Pattern: LIKE
Null checks: IS NULL, IS NOT NULL
Arithmetic: + , – , * , / , %

Aggregate Functions

COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX

Example:
SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(GPA), MIN(GPA), MAX(GPA)
FROM Student;

5.1 GROUP BY
SELECT Branch, AVG(GPA)
FROM Student
GROUP BY Branch;

5.2 HAVING
Filters groups:
SELECT Branch, COUNT()
FROM Student
GROUP BY Branch
HAVING COUNT() > 50;

Joins

Combine rows from multiple tables.

6.1 INNER JOIN
SELECT S.Name, C.CourseName
FROM Student S
INNER JOIN Enroll E ON S.RollNo = E.RollNo
INNER JOIN Course C ON C.CourseID = E.CourseID;

6.2 LEFT JOIN
SELECT S.Name, E.CourseID
FROM Student S LEFT JOIN Enroll E
ON S.RollNo = E.RollNo;

6.3 RIGHT JOIN
SELECT S.Name, E.CourseID
FROM Student S RIGHT JOIN Enroll E
ON S.RollNo = E.RollNo;

6.4 FULL OUTER JOIN
Returns all rows when match exists on either side.
(Some DBMS require UNION to simulate.)

6.5 CROSS JOIN
Cartesian product of tables.

Subqueries

7.1 Single-row Subquery
SELECT Name
FROM Student
WHERE GPA > (SELECT AVG(GPA) FROM Student);

7.2 Multi-row Subquery
SELECT Name
FROM Student
WHERE RollNo IN (SELECT RollNo FROM Enroll);

7.3 Correlated Subquery
SELECT Name
FROM Student S
WHERE GPA > (
SELECT AVG(GPA)
FROM Student
WHERE Branch = S.Branch
);

Views

Virtual table based on a query:
CREATE VIEW CS_Students AS
SELECT Name, GPA
FROM Student
WHERE Branch = 'CSE';

Constraints

Rules to maintain integrity:
• PRIMARY KEY
• FOREIGN KEY
• UNIQUE
• NOT NULL
• CHECK
• DEFAULT

Example:
CREATE TABLE Course (
ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
Title VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
Credits INT CHECK (Credits > 0),
Dept VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'CSE'
);

Indexes

Improve search speed:
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON Student(Name);

Indexes speed up SELECT but slow INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE.

Transaction Control Language (TCL)

BEGIN;
COMMIT;
ROLLBACK;

Used to enforce ACID properties.

Data Control Language (DCL)

GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON Student TO user1;
REVOKE INSERT ON Student FROM user1;

Summary

SQL supports schema creation, data manipulation, querying, joins, subqueries, views, constraints, indexing, transactions, and access control. It forms the core of relational database interaction and optimization.
