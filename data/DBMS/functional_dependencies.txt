FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCIES (FDs)

A Functional Dependency (FD) represents a relationship between attributes in a relation. It is used for identifying keys, detecting anomalies, and guiding normalization.

Definition:
X → Y means attributes X uniquely determine attributes Y.
If two tuples match on X, they must match on Y.

Examples:
RollNo → Name
RollNo → Branch

Types of Functional Dependencies:

Trivial FD:
Y ⊆ X
Example: {RollNo, Name} → RollNo

Non-Trivial FD:
Y ⊄ X
Example: RollNo → Branch

Completely Non-Trivial:
X ∩ Y = Ø
Example: A → B

Partial Dependency:
Part of a composite key determines a non-key attribute.
Violates 2NF.
Example:
(StudentID, CourseID) → Grade
StudentID → StudentName

Transitive Dependency:
X → Y and Y → Z ⟹ X → Z
Violates 3NF.
Example:
RollNo → DeptID
DeptID → DeptName

Multivalued Dependency (MVD):
A ↠ B
Relevant to 4NF.

Closure of Attributes (X⁺):
X⁺ = all attributes functionally determined by X.

Algorithm:

Start with X⁺ = X

Add attributes using FDs where LHS ⊆ X⁺

Repeat until no change

Example:
A → B, B → C
A⁺ = {A, B, C}

Finding Candidate Keys:
Steps:
• Compute closures
• If X⁺ = all attributes → superkey
• If no subset is a superkey → candidate key

Example:
R(A, B, C, D) with:
A → B
B → C
Check AD:
AD⁺ = {A, B, C, D} → candidate key = {A, D}

Armstrong’s Axioms:
Used to infer FDs.

Reflexivity: if Y ⊆ X, then X → Y

Augmentation: X → Y ⇒ XZ → YZ

Transitivity: X → Y, Y → Z ⇒ X → Z

Derived Rules:
• Union: X → Y and X → Z ⇒ X → YZ
• Decomposition: X → YZ ⇒ X → Y and X → Z
• Pseudotransitivity: X → Y and YZ → W ⇒ XZ → W

Minimal (Canonical) Cover:
FD set with:
• Single attribute on RHS
• Minimal LHS (no redundant attributes)
• No redundant FDs

Useful in decomposition and normalization.

Example Applications:

Key Identification:
R(A, B, C, D), FDs:
A → B
B → C
CD → A
CD⁺ = {C, D, A, B} → Key = {C, D}

2NF Violation:
(StudentID, CourseID) → Grade
StudentID → StudentName → partial dependency

3NF Violation:
A → B, B → C → transitive dependency

Importance of FDs:
• Identify keys
• Enable normalization (2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
• Remove redundancy
• Ensure relational integrity
• Improve schema design

Summary:
Functional Dependencies specify attribute relationships used to validate relational design. Concepts like closures, candidate keys, minimal cover, and Armstrong’s axioms support schema refinement and normalization.
