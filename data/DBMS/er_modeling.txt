ENTITY–RELATIONSHIP (ER) MODELING

ER Modeling is a conceptual database design method used to represent data, entities, relationships, and constraints visually. It helps convert real-world requirements into structured database models using ER diagrams.

Purpose of ER Modeling:
• Understand data requirements
• Identify entities and relationships
• Avoid redundancy and anomalies
• Provide blueprint for relational schema
• DBMS-independent high-level design

Key Concepts:

Entities:
A real-world object with distinct existence.
Examples: Student, Course, Employee

Entity Types:
• Strong Entity: has its own primary key
• Weak Entity: depends on strong entity, identified by partial key + owner’s key

Attributes:
Properties of entities.

Types of Attributes:
• Simple: indivisible (Age, Salary)
• Composite: can be subdivided (Address → Street, City)
• Single-Valued: one value per entity (RollNo)
• Multi-Valued: multiple values allowed (PhoneNumbers)
• Derived: computed from others (Age from DOB)
• Key Attribute: uniquely identifies entity

Relationships:
Associations between entities.
Examples: Student enrolls Course, Employee works_for Department

Relationship Degree:
• Unary: relationship within same entity
• Binary: between two entities (most common)
• Ternary: involves three entities

Relationship Cardinality:
• 1:1 (Person — Passport)
• 1:N (Department — Employee)
• M:N (Student — Course → requires bridge table)

Relationship Participation:
• Total: mandatory participation
• Partial: optional participation

Keys in ER Modeling:
• Primary Key
• Foreign Key
• Composite Key
• Partial Key (for weak entity)

Enhanced ER Model (EER):

Specialization:
One entity → multiple subtypes
Example: Employee → Full_Time, Part_Time

Generalization:
Multiple entities → one supertype
Example: Car, Bike → Vehicle

Inheritance:
Subtypes inherit attributes of parent

Constraints in Specialization/Generalization:
• Disjoint: entity belongs to one subtype
• Overlapping: entity may belong to multiple subtypes
• Total: every entity must belong to a subtype
• Partial: optional subtype membership

Aggregation:
A relationship treated as an entity in another relationship
Used when a relationship has attributes or participates in additional relations

Mapping ER to Relational Model:
• Strong entity → table
• Weak entity → table with owner key + partial key
• 1:N relationship → foreign key on N-side
• M:N relationship → separate table with both PKs
• Multivalued attribute → separate table
• Composite attribute → split into simple attributes

ER Diagram Symbols:
• Entity: rectangle
• Weak entity: double rectangle
• Attribute: oval
• Multi-valued attribute: double oval
• Derived attribute: dashed oval
• Relationship: diamond
• Identifying relationship: double diamond
• Total participation: double line
• Partial participation: single line

Summary:
ER Modeling identifies entities, attributes, and relationships to create a structured database design. EER adds inheritance, specialization, generalization, and aggregation for advanced modeling. A well-designed ER model ensures correct, normalized relational databases.
