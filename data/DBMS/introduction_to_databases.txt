INTRODUCTION TO DATABASES

A database is an organized collection of related data that is stored, managed, and accessed electronically.
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software used to create, store, retrieve, update, and secure databases.

Databases are used in banking, e-commerce, airlines, hospitals, universities, social media, and most modern applications.

What Is Data?

Data is raw facts or figures such as:
Numbers, text, dates, sensor readings

When processed, data becomes meaningful information.

What Is a Database?

A structured collection of related data stored for quick and efficient access.
Example table: STUDENT(RollNo, Name, Branch, GPA)

Databases reduce redundancy and maintain consistency.

What Is a DBMS?

Software that provides:
Defining, storing, retrieving, updating, securing, and managing data

Examples: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MongoDB

DBMS vs File-Based System

File System Issues:
• Redundancy
• Inconsistency
• Weak security
• No concurrency control
• Difficult maintenance

DBMS Advantages:
• Security and authorization
• Backup and recovery
• Data integrity
• Minimal redundancy
• Better concurrency
• Centralized control

Need for a DBMS

DBMS provides:
• Controlled redundancy
• High consistency
• Secure access
• Integrity constraints
• Parallel user access
• Crash recovery
• Data independence

Components of DBMS

• Storage Manager
• Query Processor
• Transaction Manager
• Concurrency Control Manager
• Recovery Manager
• Metadata Catalog (Data Dictionary)

Database Users

• End users
• Application programmers
• Database administrators (DBA)
• System analysts
• Database designers

Data Abstraction

Three levels of architecture:
• Physical level – how data is stored
• Logical level – what data is stored
• View level – what users see

DBMS hides storage details from users.

Data Independence

• Logical data independence – change logical schema without affecting applications
• Physical data independence – change storage without affecting schema

Database Architecture

• Single-tier
• Two-tier (client-server)
• Three-tier (UI → application server → DBMS)

Metadata

Metadata = information about database structure
Stored in system catalog: tables, data types, permissions, constraints

Advantages of DBMS

• Eliminates redundancy
• Ensures consistency
• Enforces security
• Supports concurrency
• Maintains integrity
• Provides backup and recovery
• Handles large data and complex queries
• Allows data sharing

Disadvantages of DBMS

• Expensive to implement
• Requires skilled personnel
• Uses more system resources
• Complexity increases setup and maintenance

Applications of Databases

• Banking
• Airline reservations
• Online shopping
• Social media
• Libraries
• Hospitals
• Payroll systems
• Mobile apps

Summary

A DBMS manages and stores large amounts of structured data efficiently and securely.
It overcomes limitations of file-based systems and supports key features such as concurrency, integrity, recovery, security, and data independence.
