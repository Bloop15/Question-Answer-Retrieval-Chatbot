NOSQL DATABASES

NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational, schema-less systems designed for high scalability, high availability, and handling large volumes of semi-structured or unstructured data. They are widely used in big data, social networks, recommendation systems, and IoT platforms.

Why NoSQL?

Traditional SQL systems struggle with:
• Horizontal scaling
• Highly distributed data
• Flexible schemas
• High write throughput
• Real-time processing

NoSQL enables:
• Distributed architecture
• Schema-less model
• Replication and sharding
• Eventual consistency for high performance

Characteristics of NoSQL

• Schema-less or flexible schemas
• Supports horizontal scaling
• High availability through replication
• BASE properties instead of ACID
• Partition-tolerant distributed design
• Optimized for large-scale systems

Types of NoSQL Databases

3.1 Key-Value Stores
Simple and fast lookups using key → value pairs
Examples: Redis, DynamoDB, Riak
Use cases: caching, session data, real-time dashboards

3.2 Document Stores
Store JSON/BSON/XML documents with flexible structure
Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB, Firestore
Use cases: content management, user profiles, catalogs

3.3 Column-Family Stores
Based on Google Bigtable, store data by column groups
Examples: Cassandra, HBase, ScyllaDB
Use cases: analytics, IoT logs, time-series data

3.4 Graph Databases
Represent highly connected data using nodes and edges
Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, TigerGraph
Use cases: fraud detection, social networks, recommendations

CAP Theorem

Distributed databases can provide only two out of three:
Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance

Typical NoSQL choices:
• AP systems: DynamoDB, Cassandra
• CP systems: MongoDB (configured), HBase

BASE Model

NoSQL typically follows:
• Basically Available
• Soft state
• Eventually consistent

Provides performance and scalability over strict consistency.

Replication and Partitioning

Replication: master-slave, multi-master, or peer-to-peer
Partitioning (sharding): hash-based, range-based, consistent hashing

Ensures fault tolerance and horizontal scalability.

Consistency Models

• Strong consistency: always returns latest data
• Eventual consistency: replicas converge over time
• Tunable consistency: client chooses level (e.g., Cassandra QUORUM, ONE, ALL)

Querying in NoSQL

Database-specific queries:
• MongoDB → JSON-style queries
• Cassandra → CQL
• Redis → key-based commands
• Neo4j → Cypher

No JOINs → denormalization is common.

Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:
• High scalability
• High availability
• Flexible data model
• Better performance for distributed big data

Disadvantages:
• Weaker consistency guarantees
• Limited complex transactions
• No JOINs
• Query optimization challenges

Use Cases

Redis → caching, leaderboards
MongoDB → content systems, product catalogs
Cassandra → real-time scalable messaging, IoT
Neo4j → graph analytics, fraud detection

Summary

NoSQL databases provide scalable, distributed solutions for modern applications. They support flexible schemas, high performance, and large-scale data workloads using key-value, document, column-family, and graph data models, typically relying on BASE consistency and CAP-theorem-driven design.
