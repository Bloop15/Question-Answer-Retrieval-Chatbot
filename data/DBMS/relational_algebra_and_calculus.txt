RELATIONAL ALGEBRA & RELATIONAL CALCULUS

Relational Algebra (RA) and Relational Calculus (RC) are formal query languages used to describe how data is retrieved from relational databases.

Relational Algebra → Procedural
Specifies how to get the result

Relational Calculus → Non-Procedural
Specifies what result is required

SQL is strongly influenced by both.

PART 1 — RELATIONAL ALGEBRA

Relational Algebra is a set of operations used to manipulate relations (tables). Each operation takes relations as input and produces a new relation as output.

Basic Relational Algebra Operations

1.1 Selection (σ)
Filters rows.
Notation: σ(condition)(Relation)
Example: σ(GPA > 9)(Student)

1.2 Projection (π)
Selects required columns.
Notation: π(column_list)(Relation)
Example: π(Name, Branch)(Student)
Removes duplicates automatically.

1.3 Rename (ρ)
Renames relation or attributes.
Notation:
ρ(NewName)(Relation)
ρ(RelationName(NewAttr1, NewAttr2))(Relation)

Example: ρ(S)(Student)

Set Operations
(Relations must be union compatible)

2.1 Union (∪) — rows in either relation
2.2 Intersection (∩) — rows in both relations
2.3 Set Difference (−) — rows in R not in S

Cartesian Product (×)
Combines each row of R with each row of S.
Used as basis for joins.

Joins
Combine related tuples from two relations.

4.1 Theta Join (⋈θ)
4.2 Equi-Join
4.3 Natural Join (⋈) — automatically joins on common attributes and removes duplicates
4.4 Outer Joins — Left, Right, Full (adds unmatched tuples using NULLs)

Division (÷)
Used for “for all” type queries. Example: StudentCourse ÷ Course

Extended Relational Algebra
Aggregation (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX)
Grouping
Sorting
Assignment

PART 2 — RELATIONAL CALCULUS

A declarative query language that specifies what data is required without specifying how to obtain it.

Two forms:

Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC)

Domain Relational Calculus (DRC)

Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC)

General form:
{ t | Condition(t) }
Example:
{ t.Name | t ∈ Student AND t.GPA > 9 }

Quantifiers:
∃ (exists)
∀ (for all)

Domain Relational Calculus (DRC)

General form:
{ <x1, x2, …, xn> | Condition(x1, x2, …, xn) }
Example:
{ <Name, GPA> | ∃r (r ∈ Student AND r.Name = Name AND r.GPA > 9) }

Safety Rule
Expressions must return finite results
Example of unsafe expression:
{ x | NOT(x ∈ Student) }

Comparison: Relational Algebra vs Relational Calculus

Feature	Relational Algebra	Relational Calculus
Type	Procedural	Declarative
Output	Always a relation	Set of tuples/values
Basis	Set theory	Predicate logic
Expressive Power	Equivalent	Equivalent
Similar to SQL	Partially	Strongly

Codd’s Theorem: RA and RC have equal expressive power.

Relationship to SQL

SQL combines:
• Relational Algebra operators (SELECT, PROJECT, JOIN)
• Relational Calculus logic (conditions, quantifiers)

Summary

Relational Algebra is a procedural query language using operators like selection, projection, join, union, difference, and division.
Relational Calculus is a declarative language using logical expressions (TRC and DRC).
Both are theoretically equivalent and form the foundation of SQL query processing and optimization.
