Database security consists of policies and mechanisms that protect a database from unauthorized access, misuse, attacks, corruption, and data loss. It ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of data.

Why Database Security Is Important:
• Protects sensitive and confidential data
• Ensures authorized access only
• Prevents unauthorized modifications
• Maintains availability and reliability
• Supports compliance and regulations

Security Goals (CIA Triad):

Confidentiality:
• Prevent unauthorized access to data
• Methods: authentication, access control, encryption

Integrity:
• Keep data accurate and unaltered
• Methods: integrity constraints, hashing, audit trails

Availability:
• Ensure authorized users can access data at all times
• Methods: backups, replication, load balancing, DoS protection

Database Security Threats:
• Unauthorized access
• SQL injection
• Malware and viruses
• Insider attacks
• Data leakage
• Denial of service
• Credential theft and spoofing

Access Control Mechanisms:

Authentication:
• Verifies user identity
• Methods: passwords, OTP, biometrics, certificates

Authorization:
• Controls what authenticated users can access and modify

Access Control Models:
• DAC: owner grants/revokes access
• MAC: access controlled by security levels
• RBAC: permissions assigned to roles and users assigned to roles

Encryption:

Encryption at Rest:
• Protects files, backups, disks

Encryption in Transit:
• Protects data over network (SSL/TLS)

Column-Level Encryption:
• Protects sensitive fields (e.g., passwords)

Hashing:
• Used for secure password storage
• Examples: SHA-256, bcrypt, Argon2

Auditing and Monitoring:
• Tracks logins, actions, changes
• Helps intrusion detection and compliance

Backup and Recovery:
• Ensures availability after failure or attack
• Methods: full, incremental, differential backups
• Recovery: WAL, checkpoints, ARIES
• Backups must be secure and encrypted

Database Hardening:
• Remove unused accounts and services
• Change default passwords
• Apply security patches
• Restrict remote access
• Enable firewalls
• Strong credential policies

SQL Injection Prevention:
• Use prepared statements
• Validate and sanitize inputs
• Escape special characters
• Restrict user privileges
Example:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?;

SQL Security Commands:
• GRANT: assign privileges
• REVOKE: remove privileges
• CREATE ROLE: define RBAC roles

Security in Distributed Databases:
• Challenges: multi-node environment, network vulnerabilities
• Solutions: encryption, secure replication, Kerberos, federated identity

Security in Cloud Databases:
• Risks: shared environments, greater exposure
• Measures: IAM roles, VPC isolation, KMS encryption, database firewalls, zero-trust policies

Summary:
Database security ensures that data remains confidential, accurate, and accessible. It relies on authentication, authorization, encryption, auditing, backups, secure configuration, and protection against attacks like SQL injection.
